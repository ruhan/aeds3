1 when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my fingers stretch out seeking prims warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress she must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother of course she did this is the day of the reaping i prop myself up on one elbow theres enough light in the bedroom to see them my little sister prim curled up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their cheeks pressed together in sleep my mother looks younger still worn but not so beaten down prims face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely as the primrose for which she was named my mother was very beautiful once too or so they tell me sitting
11 at prims knees guarding her is the worlds ugliest cat mashed in nose half of one ear missing eyes the color of rotting squash prim named him buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower i he hates me or at least distrusts me even though it was years ago i think he still remembers how i tried to drown him in a bucket when prim brought him home scrawny kitten belly swollen with worms crawling with fleas the last thing i needed was another mouth to feed but prim begged so hard cried even i had to let him stay it turned out okay my mother got rid of the vermin and hes a born mouser even catches the occasional rat sometimes when i clean a kill i feed buttercup the entrails he has stopped hissing at me entrails no hissing this is 
2 the closest we will ever come to love i swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots supple leather that has molded to my feet i pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up into a cap and grab my forage bag on the table under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves prims gift to me on reaping day i put the cheese carefully in my pocket as i slip outside our part of district nicknamed the seam is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour men and women with hunched shoulders swollen knuckles many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails the lines of their sunken faces but today the black cinder streets are empty shutters on the squat gray houses are closed the reaping isnt until two may as well sleep in if you can our house is almost at the edge of the seam i only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the meadow separating the meadow from the woods in fact enclosing all of district is a high chain link fence topped with barbed wire loops in theory its supposed to be electrified twenty four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods packs of wild dogs lone cougars bears that used
15 to threaten our streets but since were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings its usually safe to touch even so i always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live right now its silent as a stone concealed by a clump of bushes i flatten out on my belly and slide under a two foot stretch thats been loose for years there are several other weak spots in the fence but this one is so close to home i almost always enter the woods here as soon as im in the trees i retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log electrified or not the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh eaters out of district inside the woods they roam freely and there are added concerns like venomous snakes rabid animals and no real paths to follow but theres also food if you know how to find it my father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine 
3 explosion there was nothing even to bury i was eleven then five years later i still wake up screaming for him to run even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties more people would risk it if they had weapons but most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife my bow is a rarity crafted by my father along with a few others that i keep well hidden in the woods carefully wrapped in waterproof covers my father could have made good money selling them but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion most of the peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is in fact theyre among our best customers but the idea that someone might be arming the seam would never have been allowed in the fall a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples but always in sight of the meadow always close enough to run back to the safety of district if trouble arises district twelve where you can starve to death in safety i mutter then i glance quickly over my shoulder even here even in the middle of nowhere you worry someone might
22 overhear you when i was younger i scared my mother to death the things i would blurt out about district about the people who rule our country panem from the far off city called the capitol eventually i understood this would only lead us to more trouble so i learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts do my work quietly in school make only polite small talk in the public market discuss little more than trades in the hob which is the black market where i make most of my money even at home where i am less pleasant i avoid discussing tricky topics like the reaping or food shortages or the hunger games prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be in the woods waits the only person with whom i can be myself gale i can feel the muscles in my face relaxing my pace quickening as i climb the hills to our place a rock ledge overlooking a valley a thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes the sight of him waiting there brings on a smile gale says i never smile except in the woods hey catnip says gale my real name is katniss but when i first told him i had barely whispered it so he thought id said catnip then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts it became his official nickname for me i finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game i almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company but i got a decent price for his pelt look what i shot gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it and i laugh its real bakery bread not the flat
25 dense loaves we make from our grain rations i take it in my hands pull out the arrow and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva fine bread like this is for special occasions mm still warm i say he must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it what did it cost you just a squirrel think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning says gale even wished me luck well we all feel a little closer today dont we i say not even bothering to roll my eyes prim left us a cheese i pull it out his expression brightens at the treat thank you prim well have a real feast suddenly he falls into a capitol accent as he mimics effie trinket the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once
11 a year to read out the names at the leaping i almost forgot happy hunger games he plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us and may the odds he tosses a berry in a high arc toward me i catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth the sweet tartness explodes across my tongue be ever in your favor i finish with equal verve we have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits besides the capitol accent is so affected almost anything sounds funny in it i watch as gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread he could be my brother straight black hair olive skin we even have the same gray eyes but were not related at least not closely most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way thats why my mother and prim with their light hair and blue eyes always look out of place they are my mothers parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to officials peacekeepers and the occasional seam customer they ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of district since almost no one can afford doctors apothecaries are our healers my father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies she
23 must have really loved him to leave her home for the seam i try to remember that when all i can see is the woman who sat by blank and unreachable while her children turned to skin and bones i try to forgive her for my fathers sake but to be honest im not the forgiving type gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese carefully placing a basil leaf on each while i strip the bushes of their berries we settle back in a nook in the rocks from this place we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley which is teeming with summer life greens to gather roots to dig fish iridescent in the sunlight the day is glorious with a blue sky and soft bree ze the foods wonderful with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with gale hunting for tonights supper but instead we have to be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for the names to be called out we could do it you know gale says quietly what i ask leave the district run off live in the woods you and i we could make it says gale i dont know how to respond the idea is so preposterous if we didnt have so many kids he adds 
4 quickly theyre not our kids of course but they might as well be gales two little brothers and a sister prim and you may as well throw in our mothers too because how would they live without us who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more with both of us hunting daily there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling i never want to have kids i say i might if i didnt live here says gale but you do i say irritated forget it he snaps back the conversation feels all wrong leave how could i leave prim who is the only person in the world im certain i love and gale is devoted to his family we cant leave so why bother talking about it and even if we did even if we did where did this stuff about having kids come from theres never been anything romantic between gale and me when we met i was a skinny twelve year old and although he was only two years older he already looked like a man it took a long time for us to even become friends to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out besides if he wants kids gale wont have any trouble finding a wife hes good looking hes strong enough to handle the work in the mines and he can hunt you can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him it makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think
26 good hunting partners are hard to find what do you want to do i ask we can hunt fish or gather lets fish at the lake we can leave our poles and gather in the woods get something nice for tonight he says tonight after the reaping everyone is supposed to celebrate and a lot of people do out of relief that their children have been spared for another year but at least two families will pull their shutters lock their doors and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come we make out well the predators ignore us on a day when easier tastier prey abounds by late morning we have a do zen fish a bag of greens and best of all a gallon of strawberries i found the patch a few years ago but gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals on the way home we swing by the hob the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal when they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains the hob gradually took over the space most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day but the black markets still fairly busy we easily trade six of the fish for good bread the other two for salt greasy sae the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin we might do a tad better elsewhere but we make an
30 effort to keep on good terms with greasy sae shes the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog we dont hunt them on purpose but if youre attacked and you take out a dog or two well meat is meat once its in the soup ill call it beef greasy sae says with a wink no one in the seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog but the peacekeepers who come to the hob can afford to be a little choosier when we finish our business at the market we go to the back door of the mayors house to sell half the strawberries knowing he has a particular fondness for them and can afford our price the mayors daughter madge opens the door shes in my year at school being the mayors daughter youd expect her to be a snob but shes all right she just keeps to herself like me since neither of us really has a group of friends we seem to end up together a lot at school eating lunch sitting next to each other at assemblies partnering for sports activities we rarely talk which suits us both just fine today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon reaping clothes pretty dress says gale madge shoots him a look trying to see if its a genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic it is a pretty dress but she would never be wearing it ordinarily she presses her lips together and then smiles well if i end up going to the capitol
26 i want to look nice dont i now its gales turn to be confused does she mean it or is she messing with him im guessing the second you wont be going to the capitol says gale coolly his eyes land on a small circular pin that adorns her dress real gold beautifully crafted it could keep a family in bread for months what can you have five entries i had six when i was just twelve years old thats not her fault i say no its no ones fault just the way it is says gale madges face has become closed off she puts the money for the berries in my hand good luck katniss you
15 too i say and the door closes we walk toward the seam in silence i dont like that gale took a dig at madge but hes right of course the reaping system is unfair with the poor getting the worst of it you become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve that year your name is entered once at thirteen twice and so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen the final year of eligibility when your name goes into the pool seven times thats true for every citi zen in all twelve districts in the entire country of panem but heres the catch say you are poor and starving as we were you can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae each tessera is worth a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person you may do this for each of your family members as well so at the age of twelve i had my name entered four times once because i had to and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself prim and my mother in fact every year i have needed to do this and the entries are cumulative so now at the age of sixteen my name will be in the reaping twenty times gale who is eighteen and has been either helping or single handedly feeding a family of five for seven years will have his name in forty two times you can see why someone like madge who has never been at risk of needing a tessera can set him off the chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who
24 live in the seam not impossible but slim and even though the rules were set up by the capitol not the districts certainly not madges family its hard not to resent those who dont have to sign up for tesserae gale knows his anger at madge is misdirected on other days deep in the woods ive listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district a way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another its to the capitols advantage to have us divided among ourselves he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine if it wasnt reaping day if a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what im sure she thought was a harmless comment as we walk i glance over at gales face still smoldering underneath his stony expression his rages seem pointless to me although i never say so its not that i dont agree with him i do but what good is yelling about the capitol in the middle of the woods it doesnt change anything it doesnt make things fair it doesnt fill our stomachs in fact it scares off the nearby game i let him yell though better he does it in the woods than in the district gale and i divide our spoils leaving two fish a couple of loaves of good bread greens a quart of strawberries salt paraffin and a bit of money for each see you in the square i say wear something
23 pretty he says flatly at home i find my mother and sister are ready to go my mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days prim is in my first reaping outfit a skirt and ruffled blouse its a bit big on her but my mother has made it stay with pins even so shes having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back a tub of warm water waits for me i scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair to my surprise my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me a soft blue thing with matching shoes are you sure i ask im trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her for a while i was so angry i wouldnt allow her to do anything for me and this is something special her clothes from her past are very precious to her of course lets put your hair up too she says i let her towel dry it and braid it up on my head i can 
4 hardly recogni ze myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall you look beautiful says prim in a hushed voice and nothing like myself i say i hug her because i know these next few hours will be terrible for her her first reaping shes about as safe as you can get since shes only entered once i wouldnt let her take out any tesserae but shes worried about me that the unthinkable might happen i protect prim in every way i can but im powerless against the reaping the anguish i always feel when shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my ace i notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm tuck your tail in little duck i say smoothing the blouse back in place prim giggles and gives me a small quack quack yourself i say with a light laugh the kind only prim can draw out of me come on lets eat i say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head the fish and greens are already cooking in a stew but that will be for supper we decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal to make it special we say instead we drink milk from prims goat lady and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain although no one has much appetite anyway at one oclock we head for the square attendance is mandatory unless you are on deaths door this evening officials will come around and check to see if this is the case if not
22 youll be imprisoned its too bad really that they hold the reaping in the square one of the few places in district that can be pleasant the squares surrounded by shops and on public market days especially if theres good weather it has a holiday feel to it but today despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings theres an air of grimness the camera crews perched like bu z zards on rooftops only add to the effect people file in silently and sign in the reaping is a good opportunity for the capitol to keep tabs on the population as well twelve through eighteen year olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages the oldest in the front the young ones like prim toward the back family members line up around the perimeter holding tightly to one anothers hands but there are others too who have no one they love at stake or who no longer care who slip among the crowd taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn odds are given on their ages whether theyre seam or merchant if they will break down and weep most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully carefully these same people tend to be informers and who hasnt broken the law i could be shot on a daily basis for hunting but the appetites of those in charge protect me not everyone can claim the same anyway gale and i agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head the bullet would be much quicker the space gets tighter more claustrophobic as people arrive the squares quite large but not enough to hold district s population of about eight thousand latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where they can watch the event on screens as its televised live by the state i find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the seam we all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the justice building it holds three chairs a podium and two large glass balls one for the boys and one for the girls i stare at the paper slips in the girls ball twenty of them have katniss everdeen written on them in careful
20 handwriting two of the three chairs fill with madges father mayor undersee whos a tall balding man and effie trinket district s escort fresh from the capitol with her scary white grin pinkish hair and spring green suit they murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat just as the town clock strikes two the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read its the same story every year he tells of the history of panem the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called north america he lists the disasters the droughts the storms the fires the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land the brutal war for what little sustenance remained the result was panem a shining capitol ringed by thirteen districts which brought peace and prosperity to its citi zens then came the dark days the uprising of the districts against the capitol twelve were defeated the thirteenth obliterated the treaty of treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and as our yearly reminder that the dark days must never be repeated it gave us the hunger games the rules of the hunger games are simple in punishment for the uprising each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy called tributes to participate the twenty four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning
18 desert to a fro zen wasteland over a period of several weeks the competitors must fight to the death the last tribute standing wins taking the kids from our districts forcing them to kill one another while we watch this is the capitols way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy how little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion whatever words they use the real message is clear look how we take your children and sacrifice them and theres nothing you can do if you lift a finger we will destroy every last one of you just as we did in district thirteen to make it humiliating as well as torturous the capitol requires us to treat the hunger games as a festivity a sporting event pitting every district against the others the last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home and their district will be showered with pri zes largely consisting of food all year the capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation it is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks intones the mayor then he reads the list of past district victors in seventy four years we have had exactly two only one is still alive haymitch abernathy a paunchy middle
17 aged man who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible staggers onto the stage and falls into the third chair hes drunk very the crowd responds with its token applause but hes confused and tries to give effie trinket a big hug which she barely manages to fend off the mayor looks distressed since all of this is being televised right now district is the laughingstock of panem and he knows it he quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing effie trinket bright and bubbly as ever effie trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature happy hunger games and may the odds be ever in your favor her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off center since her encounter with haymitch she goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here although everyone knows shes just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation through the crowd i spot gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile as reapings go this one at least has a slight entertainment factor but suddenly i am thinking of gale and his forty two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor not compared to a lot of the boys and maybe hes thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away but there are still thousands of slips i wish i could whisper to him its time for the drawing effie trinket says as she always does ladies first and crosses to the glass ball with the girls names she reaches in digs her hand deep into the ball and pulls out a slip of paper the crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop and im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that its not me that its not me that its not me effie trinket crosses back to the podium smoothes the slip of paper and reads out the name in a clear voice and its not me its primrose everdeen one time when i was in a blind in a tree waiting motionless for game to wander by i do zed off and fell ten feet to the ground landing on my back it was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs and i lay there struggling to inhale to exhale to do anything thats how i feel now trying to remember how to breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull someone is gripping my arm a boy
21 from the seam and i think maybe i started to fall and he caught me there must have been some mistake this cant be happening prim was one slip of paper in thousands her chances of being chosen so remote that id not even bothered to worry about her hadnt i done everything taken the tesserae refused to let her do the same one slip one slip in thousands the odds had been entirely in
8 her favor but it hadnt mattered somewhere far away i can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelve year old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair and then i see her the blood drained from her face hands clenched in fists at her sides walking with stiff small steps up toward the stage passing me and i see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt its this detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that brings me back to myself prim the strangled cry comes out of my throat and my muscles begin to move again prim i dont need to shove through the crowd the other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage i reach her just as she is about to mount the steps with one sweep of my arm i push her behind me i volunteer i gasp i volunteer as tribute theres some confusion on the stage district hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty the rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball another eligible boy if a boys name has been read or girl if a girls name has been read can step forward to take his or her place in some districts in which winning the reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk their lives the volunteering is complicated but in district where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse volunteers are all but extinct lovely says effie trinket but i believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth then we um she trails off unsure herself what does it matter says the mayor hes looking at me with a pained expression on his face he doesnt know me really but theres a faint recognition there i am the girl who brings the strawberries the girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion the girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and sister as he presented her the oldest child with a medal of valor a medal for her father vapori zed in the mines does he remember that what does it matter he repeats gruffly let her come forward prim is screaming hysterically behind me shes wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice no katniss no you
19 cant go prim let go i say harshly because this is upsetting me and i dont want to cry when they televise the replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make note of my tears and ill be marked as an easy target a weakling i will give no one that satisfaction let go i can feel someone pulling her from my back i turn and see gale has lifted prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms up you go catnip he says in a voice hes fighting to keep steady and then he carries prim off toward my mother i steel myself and climb the steps well bravo gushes effie trinket thats the spirit of the games shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it whats your name i swallow hard katniss everdeen i say i bet my buttons that was your sister dont want her to steal all the glory do we come on everybody lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute trills effie trinket to the everlasting credit of the people of district not one person claps not even the ones holding betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring possibly because they know me from the hob or knew my father or have encountered prim who no one can help loving so instead of acknowledging applause i stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage silence which says we do not agree we do not condone all of this is wrong then something unexpected happens at least i dont expect it because i dont think of district as a place that cares about me but a shift has occurred since i stepped up to take prims place and now it seems i have become someone precious at first one then another then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me it is an old and rarely used gesture of our district occasionally seen at funerals it means thanks it means admiration it means good bye to someone you love now i am truly in danger of crying but fortunately haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me look at her look at this one he hollers throwing an arm around my shoulders hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck i like her his breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed lots of he cant think of the word for a while spunk he says triumphantly more than you he
24 releases me and starts for the front of the stage more than you he shouts pointing directly into a camera is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the capitol ill never know because just as hes opening his mouth to continue haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious hes disgusting but im grateful with every camera gleefully trained on him i have just enough time to release the small choked sound in my throat and compose myself i put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance i can see the hills i climbed this morning with gale for a moment i yearn for
19 something the idea of us leaving the district making our way in the woods but i know i was right about not running off because who else would have volunteered for prim haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and effie trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again what an exciting day she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig which has listed severely to the right but more excitement to come its time to choose our boy tribute clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she encounters she  zips back to the podium and i dont even have time to wish for gales safety when shes reading the name peeta mellark peeta mellark oh no i think not him because i recogni ze this name although i have never spoken directly to its owner peeta mellark no the odds are not in my favor today i watch him as he makes his way toward the stage medium height stocky build ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead the shock of the moment is registering on his face you can see his struggle to remain emotionless but his blue eyes show the alarm ive seen so often in prey yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place effie trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps forward he has two older brothers i know ive seen them in the bakery but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont this is standard family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day what i did was the radical thing the mayor begins to read the long dull treaty of treason as he does every year at this point its required but im not listening to a word why him i think then i try to convince myself it doesnt matter peeta mellark and i are not friends not even neighbors we dont speak our only real interaction happened years ago hes probably forgotten it but i havent and i know i never will it was during the worst time my father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest january anyone could remember the numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere doubling me over racking my body with sobs where are you i would cry out in my mind where have you gone of course there was never any answer the district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job only she didnt she didnt do anything but sit propped up in a chair or more often 
5 huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on some point in the distance once in a while shed stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only to then collapse back into stillness no amount of pleading from prim seemed to affect her i was terrified i suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness but at the time all i knew was that i had lost not only a father but a mother as well at eleven years old with prim just seven i took over as head of the family there was no choice i bought our food at the market and cooked it as best i could and tried to keep prim and myself looking presentable because if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home id grown up seeing those home kids at school the sadness the marks of angry hands on their faces the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward i could never let that happen to prim sweet tiny prim who cried when i cried before she even knew the reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school who still polished my fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the seam the community home would crush her like a bug so i kept our predicament a secret but the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death theres no other way to put it i kept telling myself if i could only hold out until may just may th i would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us only there were still several weeks to go we could well be dead by then starvations not an uncommon fate in district who hasnt seen the victims older people who cant work children from a family with too many to feed those injured in the mines straggling through the streets and one day you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall or lying in the meadow you hear the wails from a house and the peacekeepers are called 
6 in to retrieve the body starvation is never the cause of death officially its always the flu or exposure or pneumonia but that fools no one on the afternoon of my encounter with peeta mellark the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets i had been in town trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of prims in the public market but there were no takers although i had been to the hob on several occasions with my father i was too frightened to venture into that rough gritty place alone the rain had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket leaving me chilled to the bone for three days wed had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves id found in the back of a cupboard by the time the market closed i was shaking so hard i dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle i didnt pick it up for fear i would keel over and be unable to regain my feet besides no one wanted those clothes i couldnt go home because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips i couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches i had scavenged at the edge of the woods after the coal had run out my bands empty of any hope i found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople the merchants live above their businesses so i was essentially in their backyards i remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring a goat or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post hunched defeated in the muck all forms of stealing are forbidden in district punishable by death but it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins and those were fair game perhaps a bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat unfortunately the bins had just been emptied when i passed the bakers the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming i felt di z zy the ovens were in the back and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door i stood mesmeri zed by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered running its icy fingers down my back forcing me back to life i lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it spotlessly heartlessly bare suddenly a voice was screaming at me and i looked up to see the bakers wife telling me to move on and did i want her to call the peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those brats from the seam pawing through her trash the words were ugly and i had no defense as i carefully replaced the lid and backed away i noticed him a boy with
27 blond hair peering out from behind his mothers back id seen him at school he was in my year but i didnt know his name he stuck with the town kids so how would i his mother went back into the bakery grumbling but he must have been watching me as i made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree the reali zation that id have nothing to take home had finally sunk in my knees buckled and i slid down the tree trunk to its roots it was too much i was too sick and weak and tired oh so tired let them call the peacekeepers and take us to the community home i thought or better yet let me die right here in the rain there was a clatter in the bakery and i heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow and i vaguely wondered what was going on feet sloshed toward me through the mud and i thought its her shes coming to drive me away with a stick but it wasnt her it was the boy in his arms he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black his mother was yelling feed it to the pig you stupid creature why not no one decent will buy burned bread he began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and toss them into the trough and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer the boy never even glanced my way but i was watching him because of the bread because of the
19 red weal that stood out on his cheekbone what had she hit him with my parents never hit us i couldnt even imagine it the boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear then his attention back on the pig he threw a loaf of bread in my direction the second quickly followed and he sloshed back to the bakery closing the kitchen door tightly behind him i stared at the loaves in disbelief they were fine perfect really except for the burned areas did he mean for me to have them he must have because there they were at my feet before anyone could witness what had happened i shoved the loaves up under my shirt wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me and walked swiftly away the heat of the bread burned into my skin but i clutched it tighter clinging to life by the time i reached home the loaves had cooled somewhat but the insides were still warm when i dropped them on the table prims hands reached to tear off a chunk but i made her sit forced my mother to join us at the table and poured warm tea i scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread we ate an entire
12 loaf slice by slice it was good hearty bread filled with raisins and nuts i put my clothes to dry at the fire crawled into bed and fell into a dreamless sleep it didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose might have dropped the loaves into the flames knowing it meant being punished and then delivered them to me but i dismissed this it must have been an accident why would he have done it he didnt even know me still just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered couldnt explain his actions we ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school it was as if spring had come overnight warm sweet air fluffy clouds at school i passed the boy in the hall his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened he was with his friends and didnt acknowledge me in any way but as i collected prim and started for home that afternoon i found him staring at me from across the school yard our eyes met for only a second then he turned his head away i dropped my ga ze embarrassed and thats when i saw it the first dandelion of the year a bell went off in my head i thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and i knew how we were going to survive to this day i can never shake the connection between this boy peeta mellark and the bread that gave me hope and the dandelion that reminded me that i was not doomed and more than once i have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me only to quickly flit away i feel like i owe him something and i hate owing people maybe if i had thanked him at some point id be feeling less conflicted now i thought about it a couple of times but the opportunity never seemed to present itself and now it never will because were going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death exactly how am i supposed to work in a thank you in there somehow it just wont seem sincere if im trying to slit his throat the mayor finishes the dreary treaty of treason and motions for peeta and me to shake hands his are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what i think is meant to be a reassuring squee ze maybe its just a nervous spasm we turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of panem plays oh well i think there will be twenty four of us odds are someone
4 else will kill him before i do of course the odds have not been very dependable of late  the moment the anthem ends we are taken into custody i dont mean were handcuffed or anything but a group of peacekeepers
6 marches us through the front door of the justice building maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past ive never seen that happen though once inside im conducted to a room and left alone its the richest place ive ever been in with thick deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs
26 i know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff when i sit on the couch i cant help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly it helps to calm me as i try to prepare for the
25 next hour the time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones i cannot afford to get upset to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose crying is not an option there will be more cameras at the train station my sister and my mother come first i reach out to primand she climbs on my lap her arms around my neck headon my shoulder just like she did when she was a toddler my mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us for a few minutes we say nothing then i start telling themall the things they must remember to do now that i will not be there to do them for them prim is not to take any tesserae they can get by iftheyre careful on selling prims goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the seam gale will get her the herbs she doesnt grow herself but she must be very careful to describe them because hes not as familiar with them as i am hell also bring them game he and i made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensation but they
1 should thank him with some kind of trade like milk or medicine i dont bother suggesting prim learn to hunt i tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous the woods terrified her and whenever i shot something shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough but she makes out well with her goat so i concentrate on that when i am done with instructions about fuel  and trading and staying in school i turn to my mother and grip her arm hard listen to me are you listening to me she nods alarmed by my intensity she must know whats coming you cant leave again i say my mothers eyes find the floor i know i wont i couldnt help what well you have to help it this time you cant clock out
3 and leave prim on her own theres no me now to keep you both alive it doesnt matter what happens whatever you see on the screen you have to promise me youll fight through it my voice has risen to a shout in it is all the anger all the fear i felt at her abandonment she pulls her arm from my grasp moved to anger herself now i was ill i could have treated myself if id had the medicine i have now that part about her being ill might be true ive seen her bring back people suffering from immobili zing sadness since perhaps it is a sickness but its one we cant afford then take it and take care of her i say ill be all right katniss says prim clasping my face in her hands but you have to take care too youre so fast and brave maybe you can win i cant win prim must know that in her heart the competition will be far beyond my abilities kids from wealthier districts where winning is a huge honor whove been trained their whole lives for this boys who are two to three times my si ze girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife oh therell be people like me too people to weed out before the real fun begins maybe i say because i can hardly tell my mother to carry on if ive already given up myself besides it isnt in my nature to go down without a fight even when things seem insurmountable then wed be rich as haymitch i dont care if were rich i just want you to come home you will try wont you really really try asks prim really really try i swear it i say and i know because of prim ill have to and then the peacekeeper is at the door signaling our time is up and were all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all im saying is i love you i love you both and theyre saying it back and then the peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes i bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out someone else enters the room and when i look up im surprised to see its the baker peeta mellarks father i cant believe hes come to visit me after all ill be trying to kill his son soon but we do know each other a bit and he knows prim even better when she sells her goat cheeses at the hob she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return we always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife isnt around because hes so much nicer i feel certain he would never
28 have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread but why has he come to see me the baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs hes a big broad shouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens
5 he must have just said goodbye to his son he pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me i open it and find cookies these are a luxury we can never afford thank you i say the bakers not a very talkative man in the best of times and today he has no words at all i had some of your bread this morning my friend gale gave you a squirrel for it he nods as if remembering the squirrel not your best trade i say he shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter then i cant think of anything else so we sit in silence until a peacemaker summons him he rises and coughs to clear his throat ill keep an eye on the little girl make sure shes eating i feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words people deal with me but they are genuinely fond of prim maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive my next guest is also unexpected madge walks straight to me she is not weepy or evasive instead theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me they let you wear one thing from your district in the arena one thing to remind you of home will you wear this she holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier i hadnt paid much attention to it before but now i see its a small bird in flight your pin i say wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind here ill put it on your dress all right madge doesnt wait for an answer she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress promise youll wear it into the arena katniss she asks promise yes i say cookies a pin im getting all kinds of gifts today madge gives me one more a kiss on the cheek then shes gone and im left thinking that maybe madge really has been my friend all along finally gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us but when he opens his arms i dont hesitate to go into them his body is familiar to me the way it moves the smell of wood smoke even the sound of his heart beating i know from quiet moments on a hunt but this is the first time i really feel it lean and hard muscled against my own listen he says getting a knife should be pretty easy but youve got to get your hands on a bow thats your best chance they dont always have bows i say thinking of the year there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with then make one says gale
30 even a weak bow is better than no bow at all i have tried copying my fathers bows with poor results its not that easy even he had to scrap his own work sometimes i dont even know if therell be wood i say another year they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes i particularly hated that year many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst theres almost always some wood gale says since that year half
29 of them died of cold not much entertainment in that its true we spent one hunger games watching the players free ze to death at night you could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything it was considered very anti climactic in the capitol all those quiet bloodless deaths since then theres usually been wood to make fires yes theres usually some i say katniss its just hunting youre the best hunter i know says gale its not just hunting theyre armed they think i say so do you and youve had more practice real practice he says you know how to kill not people i say how different can it be really says gale grimly the awful thing is that if i can forget theyre people
27 it will be no different at all the peacekeepers are back too soon and gale asks for more time but theyre taking him away and i start to panic dont let them starve i cry out clinging to his hand i wont you know i wont katniss remember i he says and they yank us apart and slam the door and ill never know what it was he wanted me to remember its a short ride from the justice building to the train station ive never been in a car before rarely even ridden in wagons in the seam we travel on foot ive been right not to cry the station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face but ive had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and i do this now i catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall thats airing my
16 arrival live and feel gratified that i appear almost bored peeta mellark on the other hand has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up i immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the games to appear weak and frightened to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all and then come out fighting this worked very well for a girl johanna mason from district a few years back she seemed like such a sniveling cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there
20 were only a handful of contestants left it turned out she could kill viciously pretty clever the way she played it but this seems an odd strategy for peeta mellark because hes a bakers son all those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad shouldered and strong it will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him we have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us the train begins to move at once the speed initially takes my breath away of course ive never been on a train as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties for us thats mainly transporting coal but this is no ordinary coal train its one of the high speed capitol models that average miles per hour our journey to the capitol will take less than a day in school they tell us the capitol was built in a place once called the rockies district was in a region known is appalachia even hundreds of years ago they mined coal here
10 which is why our miners have to dig so deep somehow it all comes back to coal at school besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coal related except for the weekly lecture on the history of panem its mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the capitol i know there must be more than theyre telling us an actual account of what happened during the rebellion but i dont spend much time thinking about it whatever the truth is i dont see how it will help me get food on the table the tribute train is fancier than even the room in the justice building we are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom a dressing area and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water we dont have hot water at home unless we boil it there are drawers filled with fine clothes and effie trinket tells me to do anything i want wear anything i want everything is at my disposal just be ready for supper in an hour i peel off my mothers blue dress and take a hot shower ive never had a shower before its like being in a summer rain only warmer i dress in a dark green shirt and pants at the last minute i remember madges little gold pin for the first time i get a good look at it its as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it the bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips i suddenly recogni ze it a mocking jay theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the capitol during the rebellion the capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons the common term for them was muttations or sometimes mutts for short one was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memori ze and repeat whole human conversations they were homing birds exclusively male that were released into regions where the capitols enemies were known to be hiding after the birds gathered words theyd fly back to centers to be recorded it took people awhile to reali ze what was going on in the districts how private conversations were being transmitted then of course the rebels fed the capitol endless lies and the joke was on it so the centers were shut down
30 and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild only they didnt die off instead the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies they had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds from a childs high pitched warble to a mans deep tones and they could re create songs not just a few notes but whole songs with multiple verses if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice my father was particularly fond of mockingjays when we went hunting he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and after a polite pause theyd always sing back not everyone is treated with such respect but whenever my father sang all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen his voice was that beautiful high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time i could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone still theres something comforting about the little bird its like having a piece of my father with me protecting me i fasten the pin onto my shirt and with the dark green fabric as a background i can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees effie trinket comes to collect me for supper i follow her through the narrow rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls theres a table where all the dishes are highly breakable peeta mellark sits waiting for us the chair next to him empty wheres haymitch asks effie trinket brightly last time i saw him he said he was going to take a nap says peeta well its been an exhausting day says effie trinket i think shes relieved by haymitchs absence and who can blame her the supper comes in courses a thick carrot soup green salad lamb chops and mashed potatoes cheese and fruit a chocolate cake throughout the meal effie trinket keeps reminding us to save space because theres more to come but im stuffing myself because ive never had food like this so good and so much and because probably the best thing i can do between now and the games is put on a few pounds at least you two have decent manners says effie as were finishing the main course the pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages it completely upset my digestion the pair
30 last year were two kids from the seam whod never not one day of their lives had enough to eat and when they did have food table manners were surely the last thing on their minds peetas a bakers son my mother taught prim and i to eat properly so yes i can handle a fork and knife but i hate effie trinkets comment so much i make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers then i wipe my hands on the tablecloth this makes
20 her purse her lips tightly together now that the meals over im fighting to keep the food down i can see peetas looking a little green too neither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare but if i can hold down greasy saes concoction of mice meat pig entrails and tree bark a winter specialty im determined to hang on to this we go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across panem they try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live but only people in the capitol could really do that since none of them have to attend reapings themselves one by one we see the other reapings the names called the volunteers stepping forward or more often not we examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition a few stand out in my mind a monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from district a fox faced girl with sleek red hair from district a boy with a crippled foot from district and most hauntingly a twelve year old girl from district she has dark brown skin and eyes but other than that shes very like prim in si ze and demeanor only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her theres no one willing to take her place last of all they show district prim being called me running forward to volunteer you cant miss the desperation in my voice as i shove prim behind me as if im afraid no one will hear and theyll take prim away but of course they do hear i see gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage the commentators are not sure what to say about the crowds refusal to applaud the silent salute one says that district has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming as if on cue haymitch falls off the stage and they groan comically peetas name is drawn and he quietly takes his place we shake hands they cut to the anthem again and the pro gram ends effie trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation a lot about televised behavior peeta unexpectedly laughs he was drunk says peeta hes drunk every year every day i add i cant help smirking a little effie trinket makes it sound like haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from
