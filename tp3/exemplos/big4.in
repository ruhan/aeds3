28 her yes hisses effie trinket how odd you two find it amusing you know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these games the one who advises you lines up your sponsors and dictates the presentation of any gifts haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death just then haymitch
29 staggers into the compartment i miss supper he says in a slurred voice then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess so laugh away says effie trinket she hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room for a few moments peeta and i take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach the reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up we exchange a glance obviously haymitch isnt much but effie trinket is right about one thing once were in the arena hes all weve got as if by some unspoken agreement peeta and i each take one of haymitchs arms and help him to his feet i tripped haymitch asks smells bad he wipes his hand on his nose smearing his face with vomit lets get you back to your room says peeta clean you up a bit we half lead half carry haymitch back to his compartment since we cant exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread we haul him into the bathtub and turn the shower on him he hardly notices its okay peeta says to me ill take it from here i cant help feeling a little grateful since the last thing i want to do is strip down haymitch wash the vomit out of his chest hair and tuck him into bed possibly peeta is trying to make a good impression on him to be his favorite once the games begin but judging by the state hes in haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow all right i say i can send one of the capitol people to help you theres any number on the train cooking for us waiting on us guarding us taking care of us is their job no i dont want them says peeta i nod and head to my own room i understand how peeta feels i cant stand the sight of the capitol
9 people myself but making them deal with haymitch might be a small form of revenge so im pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of haymitch and all of a sudden i think its because hes being kind just as he was kind to give me the bread the idea pulls me up short a kind peeta mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there and i cant let peeta do this not where were going so i decide from this moment on to have as little as possible to do with the bakers son when i get back to my room the train is pausing at a platform to refuel i quickly open the window toss the cookies peetas father gave me out of the train and slam the glass shut no more no more of either of them unfortunately the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track i only see the image for a moment because the train is off again but its enough enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago i had just turned away from peeta mellarks bruised face when i saw the dandelion and i knew hope wasnt lost i plucked it carefully and hurried home i grabbed a bucket and prims hand and headed to the
6 meadow and yes it was dotted with the golden headed weeds after wed harvested those we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens stems and flowers that night we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread what else prim asked me what other food can we find all kinds of things i promised her i just have to remember them my mother had a book shed brought with her from the apothecary shop the pages were made of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants neat handwritten blocks told their names where to gather them when they came in bloom their medical uses but my father added other entries to the book plants for eating not healing dandelions pokeweed wild onions pines prim and i spent the rest of the night poring over those pages the next day we were off school for a while i hung around the edges of the meadow but finally i worked up the courage to go under the fence it was the first time id been there alone without my fathers weapons to protect me but i retrieved the small bow and arrows hed made me from a hollow tree i probably didnt go more than twenty yards into the woods that day most of the time i perched up in the branches of an old oak hoping for game to come by after several hours i had the good luck to kill a rabbit id shot a few rabbits before with my fathers guidance but this id done on my own we hadnt had meat in months the sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother she roused herself skinned the carcass and made a stew with the meat and some more greens prim had gathered then she acted confused and went back to bed but when the stew was done we made her eat a bowl the woods became our savior and each day i went a bit farther into its arms it was slow going at first but i was determined to feed us i stole eggs from nests caught fish in nets sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet plants are tricky many are edible but one false mouthful and youre dead i checked and double checked the plants i harvested with my fathers pictures i kept us alive any sign of danger a distant howl the inexplicable break of a branch sent me flying back to the fence at first then i began to
11 risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on bears and cats lived deeper in perhaps disliking the sooty reek of our district on may th i went to the justice building signed up for my tesserae and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in prims toy wagon on the eighth of every month i was entitled to do the same i couldnt stop hunting and gathering of course the grain was not enough to live on and there were other things to buy soap and milk and thread what we didnt absolutely have to eat i began to trade at the hob it was frightening to enter that place without my father at my side but people had respected him and they accepted me game was game after all no matter whod shot it i also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well the butcher
23 would buy my rabbits but not squirrels the baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasnt around the head peacekeeper loved wild turkey the mayor had a passion for strawberries in late summer i was washing up in a pond when i noticed the plants growing around me tall with leaves like arrowheads blossoms with three white petals i knelt down in the water my fingers digging into the soft mud and i pulled up handfuls of the roots small bluish tubers that dont look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato katniss i said aloud its the plant i was named for and i heard my fathers voice joking as long as you can find yourself youll never starve i spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick gathering the tubers that floated to the top that night we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were all for the first time in months full slowly my mother returned to us she began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food i brought in for winter people traded us or paid money for her medical remedies one day i heard her singing prim was thrilled to have her back but i kept watching waiting for her to disappear on us again i didnt trust her and some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness for her neglect for the months she had put us through prim forgave her but i had taken a step back from my mother put up a wall to protect myself from needing her and nothing was ever the same between us again now i was going to die without that ever being set right i thought of how i had yelled at her today in the justice building i had told her i loved her too though so maybe it would all balance out for a while i stand staring out the train window wishing i could open it
13 again but unsure of what would happen at such high speed in the distance i see the lights of another district i dont know i think about the people in their houses settling in for bed i imagine my home with its shutters drawn tight what are they doing now my mother and prim were they able to eat supper the fish stew and the strawberries or did it lay untouched on their plates did they watch the recap of the days events on the battered old tv that sits on the table against the wall surely there were more tears is my mother holding up being strong for prim or has she already started to slip away leaving the weight of the world on my sisters fragile shoulders prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight the thought of that scruffy old buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over prim comforts me if she cries he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep im so glad i didnt drown him imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness this day has been endless could gale and i have been eating blackberries only this morning it seems like a lifetime ago like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare maybe if i go to sleep i will wake up back in district where i belong probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns but i just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear the sheets are made of soft silky fabric a thick fluffy comforter gives immediate warmth if im going to cry now is the time to do it by morning ill be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face but no tears come im too tired or too numb to cry the only thing i feel is a desire to be somewhere else so i let the train rock me into oblivion gray light is leaking through the curtains when the rapping rouses me i hear effie trinkets voice calling me to rise up up up its going to be a big big big day i try and imagine for a moment what it must be like inside that womans head what thoughts fill her waking hours what dreams come to her at night i have no idea i put the green outfit back on since its not really dirty just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor my fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and i think of the woods and of my father and of my mother and prim waking up having to get on with things i slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesnt look too bad so i just leave it up it doesnt matter we cant be far from the capitol now and once we reach the city my stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway i just hope i get one
25 who doesnt think nudity is the last word in fashion as i enter the dining car effie trinket brushes by me with a cup of black coffee shes muttering obscenities under her breath haymitch his face puffy and red from the previous days indulgences is chuckling peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassedsit down sit down says haymitch waving me over the moment i slide into my chair im served an enormous platter of food eggs ham piles of fried potatoes a tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled the basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week theres an elegant glass of orange juice at least i think its orange juice ive only even tasted an orange once at new years when my father bought one as a special treat a cup of coffee my mother adores coffee which we could almost never afford but it only tastes bitter and thin to me a rich brown cup of something ive never seen they call it hot chocolate says peeta its good i take a sip of the hot sweet creamy liquid and a shudder runs through me even though the rest of the meal beckons i ignore it until ive drained my cup then i stuff down every mouthful i can hold which is a substantial amount being careful to not overdo it on the richest stuff one time my mother told me that i always eat like ill never see food again and i said i wont unless i bring it home that shut her up when my stomach feels like its about to split open i lean back and take in my breakfast companions peeta is still eating breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate haymitch hasnt paid much attention to his platter but hes knocking back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle judging by
4 the fumes its some kind of spirit i dont know haymitch but ive seen him often enough in the hob tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor hell be incoherent by the time we reach the capitol i reali ze i detest haymitch no wonder the district tributes never stand a chance it isnt just that weve been underfed and lack training some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it but we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the reason why the rich people who back tributes either because theyre betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner expect someone classier than haymitch to deal with so youre supposed to give us advice i say to haymitch heres some
7 advice stay alive says haymitch and then bursts out laughing i exchange a look with peeta before i remember im having nothing more to do with him im surprised to see the hardness in his eyes he generally seems so mild thats very funny says peeta suddenly he lashes out at the glass in haymitchs hand it shatters on the floor sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train only not to us haymitch considers this a moment then punches peeta in the jaw knocking him from his chair when he turns back to reach for the spirits i drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle barely missing his fingers i brace myself to deflect his hit but it doesnt come instead he sits back and squints at us well whats this says haymitch did i actually get a pair of fighters this year peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen he starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw no says haymitch stopping him let the bruise show the audience will think youve mixed it up with another tribute before youve even made it to the arena thats against the rules says peeta only if they catch you that bruise will say you fought you werent caught even better says haymitch he turns to me can you hit anything with that knife besides a table the bow and arrow is my weapon but ive spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well sometimes if ive wounded an animal with an arrow its better to get a knife into it too before i approach it i reali ze that if i want haymitchs attention this is my moment to make an impression i yank the knife out of the table get a grip on the blade and then throw it into the wall across the room i was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick but it lodges in the seam between two panels making me look a lot better than i am stand over here both of you says haymitch nodding to the
7 middle of the room we obey and he circles us prodding us like animals at times checking our muscles examining our faces well youre not entirely hopeless seem fit and once the stylists get hold of you youll be attractive enough peeta and i dont question this the hunger games arent a beauty contest but the best looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors all right ill make a deal with you you dont interfere with my drinking and ill stay sober enough to help you says haymitch but you have to do exactly what i say its not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all fine says peeta so help us i say when we get to the arena whats the best strategy at the cornucopia for someone one thing at a time in a few minutes well be pulling into the station youll be put in the hands of your stylists youre not going to like what they do to you but no matter what it is dont resist says haymitch but i begin no buts dont resist says haymitch he takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car as the door swings shut behind him the car goes dark there are still a few lights inside but outside its as if night has fallen again i reali ze we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the capitol the mountains form a natural barrier between the capitol and the eastern districts it is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels this geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today since the rebels had to scale the mountains they were easy targets for the capitols air forces peeta mellark and i stand in silence as the train speeds along the tunnel goes on and on and i think of the tons of rock separating me from the sky and my chest tightens i hate being encased in stone this way it reminds me of the mines and my father trapped unable to reach sunlight buried forever in the darkness the train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment we cant help it both peeta and i run to the window to see what weve only seen on television the capitol the ruling city of panem the cameras havent lied about its grandeur if anything they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow of hues that tower into the air the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets the oddly dressed people with bi zarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal all the colors seem artificial the pinks too
20 deep the greens too bright the yellows painful to the eyes like the flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to
22 buy at the tiny sweet shop in district the people begin to point at us eagerly as they recogni ze a tribute train rolling into the city i step away from the window sickened by their excitement
18 knowing they cant wait to watch us die but peeta holds his ground actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd he only stops when the train pulls into the station blocking us from their view he sees me staring at him and shrugs who knows he says one of them may be rich i have misjudged him i think of his actions since the reaping began the friendly squee ze of my hand his father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed prim did peeta put him up to that his tears at the station volunteering to wash haymitch but then challenging him this morning when apparently the nice guy approach had failed and now the waving at the window already trying to win the crowd all of the pieces are still fitting together but i sense he has a plan forming he hasnt accepted his death he is already fighting hard to stay alive which also means that kind peeta mellark the boy who gave me the bread is fighting hard to kill me r i i i p i grit my teeth as venia a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows yanks a strip of fabric from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it sorry she pipes in her silly capitol accent youre just so hairy why do these people speak in such a high pitch why do their jaws barely open when they talk why do the ends of their sentences go up as if theyre asking a question odd vowels clipped words and always a hiss on the letter s no wonder its impossible not to mimic them venia makes whats supposed to be a sympathetic face good news though this is the last one ready i get a grip on the edges of the table im seated on and nod the final swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk ive been in the remake center for more than three hours and i still havent met my stylist apparently he has no interest in seeing me until venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems this has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin turning my nails into uniform shapes and primarily ridding my body of hair my legs arms torso underarms and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the muff leaving me like a plucked bird ready for roasting i dont like it my skin feels sore and tingling and intensely vulnerable but i have kept my side of the bargain with haymitch and
14 no objection has crossed my lips youre doing very well says some guy named flavius he gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth if theres one thing we cant stand its a whiner grease her down venia and octavia a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin then they pull me from the table removing the thin robe ive been allowed to wear off and on i stand there completely naked as the three circle me wielding twee zers to remove any last bits of hair i know i should be embarrassed but theyre so unlike people that im no more self conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet the three step back and admire their work excellent you almost look like a human being now says flavius and they all laugh i force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful i am thank you i say sweetly we dont have much cause to look nice in district twelve this wins them over completely of course you dont you poor darling says octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me but dont worry says venia by the time cinna is through with you youre going to be absolutely gorgeous we promise you know now that weve gotten rid of all the hair and filth youre not horrible at all says flavius encouragingly lets call cinna they dart out of the room its hard to hate my prep team theyre such total idiots and yet in an odd way i know theyre sincerely trying to help me i look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my robe but this cinna my stylist will surely make me remove it at once instead my hands go to my hairdo the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone my fingers stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged my mother i left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car never thinking about retrieving them of trying to hold on to a piece of her of home now i wish i had the door opens and a young man who must be cinna enters im taken aback by how normal he looks most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed stenciled and surgically altered theyre grotesque but cinnas close cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown hes in a simple
20 black shirt and pants the only concession to self alteration seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been applied with a light hand it brings out the flecks of gold in his green
21 eyes and despite my disgust with the capitol and their hideous fashions i cant help thinking how attractive it looks hello katniss im cinna your stylist he says in a quiet voice somewhat lacking in the capitols affectations hello i venture cautiously just give me a moment all right he asks he walks around my naked body not touching me but taking in every inch of it with his eyes i resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest who did your hair my mother i say its beautiful classic really and in almost perfect balance with your profile she has very clever fingers he says i had expected someone flamboyant someone older trying desperately to look young someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter cinna has met none of these expectations youre new arent you i dont think ive seen you before i say most of the stylists are familiar constants in the ever changing pool of tributes some have been around my whole life yes this is my first year in the games says cinna so they gave you district twelve i say newcomers generally end up with us the least desirable district i asked for district twelve he says without further explanation why dont you put on your robe and well have a chat pulling on my robe i follow him through a door into a sitting room two red couches face off over a low table three walls are blank the fourth is entirely glass providing a window to the city i can see by the light that it must be around noon although the sunny sky has turned overcast cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me he presses a button
2 on the side of the table the top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain tiny green peas and onions rolls shaped like flowers and for dessert a pudding the color of honey i try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home chickens are too expensive but i could make do with a wild turkey id need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange goats milk would have to substitute for cream we can grow peas in the garden id have to get wild onions from the woods i dont recogni ze the grain our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker perhaps for two or three squirrels as for the pudding i cant even guess whats in it days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the capitol version what must it be like i wonder to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button how would i spend the hours i now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by what do they do all day these people in the capitol besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment i look up and find cinnas eyes trained on mine how despicable we must seem to you he says has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts hes right though the whole rotten lot of them is despicable no matter says cinna so katniss about your costume for the opening ceremonies my partner portia is the stylist for your fellow tribute peeta and our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes says cinna as you know its customary to reflect the flavor of the district for the opening ceremonies youre supposed to wear something that suggests your districts principal industry district agriculture district fishing district factories this means that coming from district peeta and i will be in some kind of coal miners getupsince the baggy miners jumpsuits are not particularly becoming our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps one year our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent coal dust its always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd i prepare myself for the worst so ill be in a coal miner outfit i
23 ask hoping it wont be indecent not exactly you see portia and i think that coal miner things very overdone no one will remember you in that and we both see it as our job to make the district twelve tributes unforgettable says cinna ill be naked for sure i think so rather than focus on the coal mining itself were going to focus on the coal says cinna naked and covered in black dust i think and what do we do with coal we burn it says cinna youre not afraid of fire are you katniss he sees my expression and grins a few hours later i am dressed in what will either be the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies im in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck shiny leather boots lace up to my knees but its the fluttering cape made of streams of orange yellow and red and the matching headpiece that define this costume cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the streets its not real flame of course just a little synthetic fire portia and i came up with youll be perfectly safe he says but im not convinced i wont be perfectly barbecued by the time we reach the citys center my face is relatively clear of makeup just a bit of highlighting here and there my hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style i want the audience to recogni ze you when youre
15 in the arena says cinna dreamily katniss the girl who was on fire it crosses my mind that cinnas calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman despite this mornings revelation about peetas character im actually relieved when he shows up dressed in an identical costume he should know about fire being a bakers son and all his stylist portia and her team accompany him in and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash well make except cinna he just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations were whisked down to the bottom level of the remake center which is essentially a gigantic stable the opening ceremonies are about to start pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horsesours are coal black the animals are so well trained no one even needs to guide their reins cinna and portia direct us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions the drape of our capes before moving off to consult with each other what do you think i whisper to peeta about the fire ill rip off your cape if youll rip off mine he says through gritted teeth deal i say maybe if we can get them off soon enough well avoid the worst burns its bad though theyll throw us into the arena no matter what condition were in i know we promised haymitch wed do exactly what they said but i dont think he considered this angle where is haymitch anyway isnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing says peeta with all that alcohol in him its probably not advisable to have him around an open flame i say and suddenly were both laughing i guess were both so nervous about the games and more pressingly petrified of being turned into human torches were not acting sensibly the opening music begins its easy to hear blasted around the capitol massive doors slide open revealing the crowd lined streets the ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the city circle where they will welcome us play the anthem and escort us into the training center which will be our home prison until the games begin the tributes from district ride
4 out in a chariot pulled by snow white horses they look so beautiful spray painted silver in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels district makes luxury items for the capitol you can hear the roar of the crowd they are always favorites district gets into position to follow them in no time at all we are approaching the door and i can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray the tributes from district are just rolling out when cinna appears with a lighted torch here we go then he says and before we can react he sets our capes on fire i gasp waiting for the heat but there is only a faint tickling sensation cinna climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses he lets out a sign of relief it works then he gently tucks a hand under my chin remember heads high smiles theyre going to love you cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea he shouts something up at us but the music drowns him out he shouts again and gestures whats he saying i ask peeta for the first time i look at him and reali ze that abla ze with the fake flames he is da z zling and i must be too i think he said for us to hold hands says peeta he grabs my right hand in his left and we look to cinna for confirmation he nods and gives a thumbs up and thats the last thing i see before we enter the city the crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of district twelve every head is turned our way pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us at first im fro zen but then i catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look in the deepening twilight the firelight illuminates our faces we seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes cinna was right about the minimal makeup we both look more attractive but utterly recogni zable remember heads high smiles theyre going to love you i hear cinnas voice in my head i lift my chin a bit higher put on my most winning smile and wave with my free hand im glad now i have peeta to clutch for balance he is so steady solid as a rock as i gain confidence i actually blow a few kisses to the crowd the people of the capitol are going nuts showering us with flowers shouting our names our first names which they have bothered to find on the program the pounding music the cheers the admiration work their way into my blood and i cant suppress my excitement cinna has given me a great advantage no one will forget me not my look not my name katniss
18 the girl who was on fire for the first time i feel a flicker of hope rising up in me surely there must be one sponsor willing to take me on and with a little extra help some food the right weapon why should i count myself out of the games someone throws me a red rose i catch it give it a delicate sniff and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver a hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss as if it were a real and tangible thing katniss katniss i can hear my name being called from all sides everyone wants my kisses its not until we enter the city circle that i reali ze i must have completely stopped the circulation in peetas hand thats how tightly ive been holding it i look down at our linked fingers as i loosen my grasp but he regains his grip on me no dont let go of me he says the firelight flickers off his blue eyes please i might fall out of this thing okay i say so i keep holding on but i cant help feeling strange about the way cinna has linked us together its not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other the twelve chariots fill the loop of the city circle on the buildings that surround the circle every window is packed with the most prestigious citi zens of the capitol our horses pull our chariot right up to president snows mansion and we come to a halt the music ends with a flourish the president a small thin man with paper white hair gives the official welcome from a balcony above us it is traditional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the speech but i can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime the darker it becomes the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering when the national anthem plays they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes but the camera holds on the district chariot as it parades around the circle one final time and disappears into the training center the doors have only just shut behind us when were engulfed by the prep teams who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise as i glance around i notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks which confirms what ive suspected weve literally outshone them all then cinna and portia are there helping us
16 down from the chariot carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses portia extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister i reali ze im still glued to peeta and force my stiff fingers to open we both massage our hands thanks for keeping hold of me i was getting a little shaky there says peeta it didnt show i tell him im sure no one noticed im sure they didnt notice anything but you you should wear flames more often he says they suit you and then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me a warning bell goes off in my head dont be so stupid peeta is planning how to kill you i remind myself he is luring you in to make you easy prey the more likable he is the more deadly he is but because two can play at this game i stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek right on his bruise the training center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams this will be our home until the actual games begin each district has an entire floor you simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district easy enough to remember ive ridden the elevator a couple of times in the justice building back in district once to receive the medal for my fathers death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends and family but thats a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk the walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air its exhilarating and im tempted to ask effie trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that seems childish apparently effie trinkets duties did not conclude at the station she and haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena in a way thats a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we havent seen haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train probably passed out somewhere effie trinket on the other hand seems to be flying high were the first team shes ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies shes complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves and to hear her tell it effie knows everyone whos anyone in the capitol and has been talking us up all day trying to win us sponsors ive been very mysterious though she says her eyes squint half shut because of course haymitch hasnt bothered to tell me your strategies but ive done my best with what i had to work with how katniss sacrificed herself for her sister how youve both
17 successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district barbarism thats ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter and whats she basing our success on our table manners everyone has their reservations naturally you being from the coal district but i said and this was very clever of me i said well if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its wrong coal doesnt turn to pearls they grow in shellfish possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds but thats untrue too ive heard they have some sort of machine in district that can turn graphite into diamonds but we dont mine graphite in district that was part of district s job until they were destroyed i wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all day either know or care unfortunately i cant seal the sponsor deals for you only haymitch can do that says effie grimly but dont worry ill get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary although lacking in many departments effie trinket has a certain determination i have to admire my quarters are larger than our entire house back home they are plush like the train car but also have so many automatic gadgets that im sure i wont have time to press all the buttons the shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature pressure soaps shampoos scents oils and massaging sponges when you step out on a mat heaters come on that blow dry your body instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair i merely place my hand on a box that sends a current through my scalp untangling parting and drying my hair almost instantly it floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain i program the closet for an outfit to my taste the windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command you need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears hot and steamy before you in less than a minute i walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until theres
6 a knock on the door effies calling me to dinner good im starving peeta cinna and portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the capitol when we enter the dining room im glad to see the stylists particularly after i hear that haymitch will be joining us a meal presided over by just effie and haymitch is bound to be a disaster besides dinner isnt really about food its about planning out our strategies and cinna and portia have already proven how valuable they are a silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine i think about turning it down but ive never had wine except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs and when will i get a chance to try it again i take a sip of the tart dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served it looks as if hes had his own stylist because hes clean and groomed and about as sober as ive ever seen him he doesnt refuse the offer of wine but when he starts in on his soup i reali ze its the first time ive ever seen him eat maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us cinna and portia seem to have a civili zing effect on haymitch and effie at least theyre addressing each other decently and they both have nothing but praise for our stylists opening act while they make small talk i concentrate on the meal mushroom soup bitter greens with tomatoes the si ze of peas rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper noodles in a green sauce cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes the servers all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine move wordlessly to and from the table keeping the platters and glasses full about halfway through my glass of wine my head starts feeling foggy so i change to water instead i dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon how haymitch can stand walking around like this full time is a mystery i try to focus on the talk which has turned to our interview costumes when a girl sets a gorgeous looking cake on the table and deftly lights it it bla zes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out i have a moment of doubt what makes it burn is it alcohol i say looking up at the girl thats the last thing i wa oh i know you i cant place a name or time to the girls face but im certain of it the dark red hair the striking features the porcelain white skin but even as i utter the words i feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her and while i cant pull it up i know some bad memory is associated with her the expression
23 of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease she shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table when i look back the four adults are watching me like hawks dont be ridiculous katniss how could you possibly know an avox snaps effie the very thought whats an avox i ask stupidly someone who committed a crime they cut her tongue so she cant speak says haymitch shes probably a traitor of some sort not likely youd know her and even if you did youre not to speak to one of them unless its to give an order says effie of course you dont really know her but i do know her and now that haymitch has mentioned the word traitor i remember from where the disapproval is so high i could never admit it no i guess not i just i stammer and the wine is not helping peeta snaps his fingers delly cartwright thats who it is i kept thinking she looked familiar as well then i reali zed shes a dead ringer for delly delly cartwright is a pasty faced lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly she may also be the friendliest person on the planet she smiles constantly at everybody in school even me i have never seen the girl with the red hair smile but i jump on peetas suggestion gratefully of course thats who i was thinking of it must be the hair i say something about the eyes too says peeta the energy at the table relaxes oh well if thats all it is says cinna and yes the cake has spirits but all the alcohol has burned off i ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut we eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies thats being broadcast a few of the other couples make a nice impression but none of them can hold a candle to us even our own party lets out an ahh as they show us coming out of the remake center whose idea was the hand holding asks haymitch cinnas says
18 portia just the perfect touch of rebellion says haymitch very nice rebellion i have to think about that one a moment but when i remember the other couples standing stiffly apart never touching or acknowledging each other as if their fellow tribute did not exist as if the games had already begun i know what haymitch means presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes tomorrow morning is the first training session meet me for breakfast and ill tell you exactly how i want you to play it says haymitch to peeta and i now go get some sleep while the grown ups talk peeta and i walk together down the corridor to our rooms when we get to my door he leans against the frame not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting i pay attention to him so delly cartwright imagine finding her lookalike here hes asking for an explanation and im tempted to give him one we both know he covered for me so here i am in his debt again if i tell him the truth about the girl somehow that might even things up how can it hurt really even if he repeated the story it couldnt do me much harm it was just something i witnessed and he lied as much as i did about delly cartwright i reali ze i do want to talk to someone about the girl someone who might be able to help me figure out her story gale would be my first choice but its unlikely ill ever
17 see gale again i try to think if telling peeta could give him any possible advantage over me but i dont see how maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe i see him as a friend besides the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me she has reminded me why im here not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies but to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer to tell or not to tell my brain still feels slow from the wine i stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there peeta picks up on my hesitation have you been on the roof yet i shake my head cinna showed me you can practically see the whole city the winds a bit loud though i translate this into no one will overhear us talking in my head you do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here can we just go up sure come on says peeta i follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof theres a small dome shaped room with a door to the outside as we step into the cool windy evening air i catch my breath at the view the capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies electricity in district comes and goes usually we only have it a few hours a day often the evenings are spent in candlelight the only time you can count on it is when theyre airing the games or some important government message on television that its mandatory to watch but here there would be no shortage ever peeta and i walk to a railing at the edge of the roof i look straight down the side of the building to the street which is bu z zing with people you can hear their cars an occasional shout and a strange metallic tinkling in district wed all be thinking about bed right now i asked cinna why they let us up here werent they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side says peeta whatd he say i ask you cant says peeta he holds out his hand into seemingly empty space theres
