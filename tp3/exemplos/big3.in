8 hats right youre district eleven agriculture i say orchards huh that must be how you can fly around the trees like youve got wings rue smiles ive landed on one of the few things shell admit pride in well come on then fix me up i plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee to my surprise rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew them my mother would use other methods but its not like we have a lot of options after a minute or so rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee ohhh the sound comes out of my mouth before i can stop it its as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting rue gives a giggle lucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or youd be a lot worse do my neck do my cheek i almost beg rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth and soon im laughing because the relief is so sweet i notice a long burn on rues forearm ive got something for that i set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine you have good sponsors she says longingly have you gotten anything yet i ask she shakes her head you will though watch the closer we get to the end the more people will reali ze how clever you are i turn the meat over you werent joking about wanting me for an ally she asks no i meant it i say i can almost hear haymitch groaning as i team up with this wispy child but i want her because shes a survivor and i trust her and why not admit it she reminds me of prim okay she says and holds out her hand we shake its a deal of course this kind of deal can only be temporary but neither of us mentions that rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal roasted over the fire they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip she recogni zes the bird too some wild thing they call a groosling in her district she says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day for a while all conversation stops as we fill our stomachs the groosling has delicious meal thats so fatty the grease drips down your face when you bite into it oh says rue with a sigh ive never had a whole
9 leg to myself before ill bet she hasnt ill bet meat hardly ever comes her way take the other i say really she asks take whatever you want now that ive got a bow and arrows i can get more plus ive got snares i can show you how to set them i say rue still looks uncertainly at the leg oh take it i say putting the drumstick in her hands it will only keep a few days anyway and weve got the whole bird plus the rabbit once shes got hold of it her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful id have thought in district eleven youd have a bit more to eat than us you know since you grow the food i say rues eyes widen oh no were not allowed to eat the crops they arrest you or something i ask they whip you and make everyone else watch says rue the mayors very strict about it i can tell by her expression that its not that uncommon an occurrence a public whippings a rare thing in district although occasionally one occurs technically gale and i could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods well technically we could get a whole lot worse except all the officials buy our meat besides our mayor madges father doesnt seem to have much taste for such events maybe being the least prestigious poorest most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages such as being largely ignored by the capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas do you get all the coal you want rue asks no i answer just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots they feed us a bit extra during harvest so that people can keep going longer says rue dont you have to be in school i ask not during harvest everyone works then says rue its interesting hearing about her life we have so little communication with anyone outside our district in fact i wonder if the gamemakers are blocking out our conversation because even though the information seems harmless they dont want people in different districts to know about one another at rues suggestion we lay out all our food to plan ahead shes seen most of mine but i add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile shes gathered quite a collection of roots nuts greens and even some berries i roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers you sure this is safe oh yes we have them back home ive been eating them for days she says popping a handful in her mouth i tentatively bite into one and its as good as our blackberries taking rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time we divide up our food supplies so in case were separated well both be set for a few days apart from the food rue has a small water skin a homemade slingshot and an extra pair of socks she also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife i know its not much she says as
11 if embarrassed but i had to get away from the cornucopia fast you did just right i say when i spread out my gear she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses how did you get those she asks in my pack theyve been useless so far they dont block the sun and they make it harder to see i say with a shrug these arent for sun theyre for darkness exclaims rue sometimes when we harvest through the night theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees where the torchlight doesnt reach one time this boy martin he tried to keep his pair hid it in his pants they killed him on the spot they killed a boy for taking these i say yes and everyone knew he was no danger martin wasnt right in the head i mean he still acted like a three year old he just wanted the glasses to play with says rue hearing this makes me feel like district is some sort of safe haven of course people keel over from starvation all the time but i cant imagine the peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child theres a little girl one of greasy saes grandkids who wanders around the hob shes not quite right but shes treated as a sort of pet people toss her scraps and things so what do these do i ask rue taking the glasses they let you see in complete darkness says rue try them tonight when the sun goes down i give rue some matches and she makes sure i have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again we extinguish our fire and head upstream until its almost nightfall where do you sleep i ask her in the trees she nods in just your jacket rue holds up her extra pair of socks i have these for my hands i think of how cold the nights have been you can share my sleeping bag if you want well both easily fit her face lights up i can tell this is more than she dared hope for we pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play there were no deaths today rue i only woke up today how many nights did i miss the anthem should block out our words but still i whisper i even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand i dont want the audience to know what im planning to tell her about peeta taking a cue from me she does the same two she says the girls from districts one and four are dead theres ten of us left something strange happened at least i think it did it might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things i say you know the boy from my district peeta i think he saved my life but he was with the careers hes not with them now she says ive spied on their base camp by the lake they made it back before they collapsed from the stingers but hes not there maybe he did save you and had to run i dont answer if in fact peeta did save me im in his debt again and this cant be paid back if he did it was all probably just part of his act you know to make people think hes in love with me oh says rue thoughtfully i didnt think that was an act course it is i say he worked it out with our mentor the anthem ends and the sky goes dark lets try out these glasses i pull out the glasses and slip them on rue wasnt kidding i can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away i could kill it from here if i had a mind to i could kill anyone i wonder who else got a pair of these i say the careers have two pairs but theyve got everything down by the lake rue says and theyre so strong were strong too i say just in a different way you are you can shoot she says what can i do you can feed yourself can they i ask they dont need to they have all those supplies rue says say they didnt say the supplies were gone how long would they last i say i mean its the hunger games right but katniss theyre not hungry says rue no theyre not thats the problem i agree and for the first time i have a plan a plan that isnt motivated by the need for flight and evasion an offensive plan i think were going to have to fix that rue rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly i know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up against me and falls asleep nor do i have any misgivings about her as i take no particular precautions if shed wanted me dead all she would have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest needling me at the very back of my mind is the obvious both of us cant win these games but since the odds are still against either of us surviving i manage to ignore the thought besides im distracted by my latest idea about the careers and their supplies somehow rue and i must find a way to destroy their food im pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle traditionally the career tributes strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there the years when they have not protected it well one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it another a gamemakers flood washed it away those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won that the careers have been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage because they dont know how to be hungry not the way rue and i do but im too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight my wounds recovering my mind still a bit foggy from the venom and the warmth of rue at my side her head cradled on my shoulder have given me a sense of security i reali ze for the first time how very lonely ive been in the arena how comforting the presence of another human being can be i give in to my drowsiness resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn tomorrow its the
21 careers who will have to watch their backs the boom of the cannon jolts me awake the skys streaked with light the birds already chattering rue perches in a branch across from me her hands cupping something we wait listening for more shots but there arent any who do you think that was i cant help thinking of peeta i dont know it could have been any of the others says rue i guess well know tonight whos left again i ask the boy from district one both tributes from two the boy from three thresh and me and you and peeta says rue thats eight wait and the boy from ten the one with the bad leg he makes nine theres someone else but neither of us can remember who it is i wonder how that last one died says rue no telling but its good for
21 us a death should hold the crowd for a bit maybe well have time to do something before the gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly i say whats in your hands breakfast says rue she holds them out revealing two big eggs what kind are those i ask not sure theres a marshy area over that way some kind of waterbird she says itd be nice to cook them but neither of us wants to risk a fire my guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the careers which means theyve recovered enough to be back in the games we each suck out
14 the insides of an egg eat a rabbit leg and some berries its a good breakfast anywhere ready to do it i say pulling on my pack do what says rue but by the way she bounces up you can tell shes up for whatever i propose today we take out the careers food i say really how you can see the glint of excitement in her eyes in this way shes exactly the opposite of prim for whom adventures are an ordeal no idea come on well figure out a plan while we hunt i say we dont get much hunting done though because im too busy getting every scrap of information i can out of rue about the careers base shes only been in to spy on them briefly but shes observant they have set up their camp beside the lake their supply stash is about thirty yards away during the day theyve been leaving another tribute the boy from district to watch over the supplies the boy from district three i ask hes working with them yes he stays at the camp full time he got stung too when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake says rue i guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard but hes not very big what weapons does he have i ask not much that i could see a spear he might be able to hold a few of us off with that but thresh could kill him easily says rue and the foods just out in the open i say she nods somethings not quite right about that whole setup i know but i couldnt tell what exactly says rue katniss even if you could get to the food how would you get rid of it burn it dump it in the lake soak it in fuel i poke rue in the belly just like i would prim eat it she giggles dont worry ill think of something destroying things is much easier than making them for a while we dig roots we gather berries and greens we devise a strategy in hushed voices and i come to know rue the oldest of six kids fiercely protective of her siblings who gives her rations to the younger ones who forages in the meadows in a district where the peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours rue who when you ask her what she loves most in the world replies of all things music music i say in our world i rank music somewhere between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness at least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather you have a lot of time for that we sing at home at work too thats why i love your pin she says pointing to the mockingjay that ive again forgotten about you have mockingjays i ask oh yes i have a few that are my special friends we can sing back and forth for hours they carry messages for me she says what do you mean i say im usually up highest so im the first to see the flag that signals quitting time theres a special little song i do says rue she opens her mouth and sings a little four note run in a sweet clear voice and the mockingjays spread it around the orchard thats how everyone knows to knock off she continues they can be dangerous though if you get too near their nests but you cant blame them for that i unclasp the pin and hold it out to her here you take it it has more meaning for you than me oh no says rue closing my fingers back over the pin i like to see it on you thats how i decided i could trust you besides i have this she pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt on it hangs a roughly carved wooden star or maybe its a flower its a good luck charm
12 well its worked so far i say pinning the mockingjay back on my shirt maybe you should just stick with that by lunch we have a plan by early afternoon we are poised to carry it out i help rue collect and place the wood for the first two campfires the third shell have time for on her own we decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together the stream should help guide me back to it before i leave i make sure rues well stocked with food and matches i even insist she take my sleeping bag in case its not possible to rende zvous by nightfall what about you wont you be cold she asks not if i pick up another bag down by the lake i say you know stealing isnt illegal here i say with a grin at the last minute rue decides to teach me her mockingjay signal the one she gives to indicate the days work is done it might not work but if you hear the mockingjays singing it youll know im okay only i cant get back right away are there many mockingjays here i ask havent you seen them theyve got nests everywhere she says i have to admit i havent noticed okay then if all goes according to plan ill see you for dinner i say unexpectedly rue throws her arms around me i only hesitate a moment before i hug her back you be careful she says to me you too i say i turn and head back to the stream feeling somehow worried about rue being killed about rue not being killed and the two of us being left for last about leaving rue alone about leaving prim alone back home no prim has my mother and gale and a baker who has promised she wont go hungry rue has only me once i reach the stream i have only to follow it downhill to the place i initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack i have to be cautious as i move along the water though because i find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions most of which concern peeta the cannon that fired early this morning did that signify his death if so how did he die at the hand of a career and was that in revenge for letting me live i struggle again to remember that moment over glimmers body when he burst through the trees but just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened i must have been moving very slowly yesterday because i reach the shallow stretch where i took my bath in just a few hours i stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack it seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times i cover it my proximity to the careers camp sharpens my senses and the closer i get to them the more guarded i am pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow i dont see any other tributes
7 but i do notice some of the things rue has mentioned patches of the sweet berries a bush with the leaves that healed my stings clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree i was trapped in and here and there the black and white flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head when i reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot i pause a moment to gather my courage rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this
7 point remember i tell myself youre the hunter now not them i get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on i make it to the copse rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness its right at the edge of the wood but the bushy foliage is so thick down low i can easily observe the career camp without being spotted between us lies the flat expanse where the games began there are four tributes the boy from district cato and the girl from district and a scrawny ashen skinned boy who must be from district he made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the capitol i can remember almost nothing about him not his costume not his training score not his interview even now as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box hes easily ignored in the presence of his
2 large and domineering companions but he must be of some value or they wouldnt have bothered to let him live still seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the careers would possibly leave him as a guard why they have allowed him to live at all all four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker jacker attack even from here i can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies they must not have had the sense to remove the stingers or if they did not known about the leaves that healed them apparently whatever medicines they found in the cornucopia have been ineffective the cornucopia sits in its original position but its insides have been picked clean most of the supplies held in crates burlap sacks and plastic bins are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the cornucopia at the onset of the games a canopy of netting that aside from discouraging birds seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself the whole setup is completely perplexing the distance the netting and the presence of the boy from district one things for sure destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks some other factor is at play here and id better stay put until i figure out what it is my guess is the pyramid is booby trapped in some manner i think of concealed pits descending nets a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart really the possibilities are endless while i am mulling over my options i hear cato shout out hes pointing up to the woods far beyond me and without turning i know that rue must have set the first campfire wed made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable the careers begin to arm themselves at once an argument breaks out its loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from district should stay or accompany them hes coming we need him in the woods and his jobs done here anyway no one can touch those supplies says cato what about lover boy says the boy from district i keep telling you forget about him i know where i cut him its a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet at any rate hes in no shape to raid us says cato so peeta is out there in the woods wounded badly but i am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the careers come on says cato he thrusts a spear into the hands of the boy from district and they head off in the direction of the fire the last thing i hear as they enter the woods is cato saying when we find her i kill her in my own way and no one interferes somehow i dont think hes talking about rue she didnt drop a nest of acker jackers on him i stay put for a half an hour or so trying to figure out what to do about the supplies the one advantage i have with the bow and arrow is distance i could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough im a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net but theres no guarantee it would catch more likely itd just burn itself out and then what id have achieved nothing and given them far too much information about myself that i was here that i have an accomplice that i can use the bow and arrow with accuracy theres no alternative im going to have to get in closer and see if i cant discover what exactly protects the supplies in fact im just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye several hundred yards to my right i see someone emerge from the woods for a second i think its rue but then i recogni ze foxface shes the one we couldnt remember this morning creeping out onto the plain when she decides its safe she runs for the pyramid with quick small steps just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid she stops searches the ground and carefully places her feet on a spot then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops sometimes landing on one foot teetering slightly sometimes risking a few steps at one point she launches up in the air over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes but she overshot slightly and her momentum throws her forward i hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground but nothing happens in a moment shes regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies so im right about the booby trap but its clearly more complex than i had imagined i was right about the girl too how wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly she fills her pack taking a few items from a variety of containers crackers from a crate a handful of apples from a burlap
15 sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin but only a handful from each not enough to tip off that the food is missing not enough to cause suspicion and then shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again safe and sound i reali ze im grinding my teeth in frustration foxface has confirmed what id already guessed but what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity has so many trigger points why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth youd have thought and slowly it begins to dawn on me youd have thought the very ground was going to explode its mined i whisper that explains everything the careers willingness to leave their supplies foxfaces reaction the involvement of the boy from district where they have the factories where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives but where did he get them in the supplies thats not the sort of weapon the gamemakers usually provide given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally i slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena the ground around it has been dug up and patted back down the land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates but the boy from district must have managed to reactivate them ive never seen anyone in the games do that i bet it came as a shock even to the gamemakers well hurray for the boy from district for putting one over on them but what am i supposed to do now obviously i cant go strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky high as for sending in a burning arrow thats more laughable than ever the mines are set off by pressure it doesnt have to be a lot either one year a girl dropped her token a small wooden ball while she was at her plate and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground my arms pretty good i might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what maybe one mine that could start a chain reaction or could it would the boy from district have placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not disturb the others thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader even if i only blew up one mine id draw the careers back down on me for sure and anyway what am i thinking theres that net clearly strung to deflect any such attack besides what id really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once setting off a big chain reaction demolishing the whole lot i glance back up at the woods the smoke from rues second fire is wafting toward the sky by now the careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick time is running out there is a solution to this i know there is if i can only focus hard enough i stare at the pyramid the bins the crates too heavy to topple over with an arrow maybe one contains cooking oil and the burning arrow idea is reviving when i reali ze i could end uplosing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin since id just be guessing im genuinely thinking of trying to re create foxfaces trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples i could sever the rope in one shot didnt i do as much in the training center its a big bag but it still might only be good for one explosion if only i could free the apples themselves i know what to do i move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done i place my feet carefully block out the rest of the world as i take meticulous aim the first arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top leaving a split in the burlap the second widens it to a gaping hole i can see the first apple teetering when i let the third arrow go catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag for a moment everything seems fro zen in time then the apples spill to the ground and im blown backward into the air the impact with the hard packed earth of the plain knocks the wind out of me my backpack does little to soften the blow fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow sparing both itself and my shoulder and my bow is locked in my grasp the ground still shakes with explosions i cant hear them i cant hear anything at the moment but the apples must have set off enough mines causing debris to activate the others i manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter some of it burning rain down around me an acrid smoke fills the air which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe after about a minute the ground stops vibrating i roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid the careers arent likely to salvage anything out of that id better get out of here i think theyll be making a beeline for the place but once im on my feet i reali ze escape may not be so simple im di z zy not the slightly wobbly kind but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet i take a few steps
22 and somehow wind up on my hands and knees i wait a few minutes to let it pass but it doesnt panic begins to set in i cant stay here flight is essential but i can neither walk nor hear i place a hand to my left ear the one that was turned toward the blast and it comes away bloody have i gone deaf from the explosion the idea frightens me i rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter maybe more at times but i cant let my fear show absolutely positively i am live on every screen in panem no blood trails i tell myself and manage to pull my hood up over my head tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative fingers that should help soak up the blood i cant walk but can i crawl i move forward tentatively yes if i go very slowly i can crawl most of the woods will offer insufficient cover my only hope is to make it back to rues copse and conceal myself in greenery i cant get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open not only will i face death its sure to be a long and painful one at catos hand the thought of prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout another blast knocks me flat on my face a stray mine set off by some collapsing crate this happens twice more im reminded of those last few kernels that burst when prim and i pop corn over the fire at home to say i make it in the nick of time is an understatement i have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes at the base of the trees when theres cato barreling onto the plain soon followed by his companions his rage is so extreme it might be comical so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists if i didnt know that it was aimed at me at what i have done to him add to that my proximity my inability to run or defend myself and in fact the whole thing has me terrified im glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because im biting my nails like theres no tomorrow gnawing off the last bits of nail polish trying to keep
18 my teeth from chattering the boy from district throws stones into the ruins and must have declared all the mines activated because the careers are approaching the wreckage cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers the other tributes are poking around in the mess looking for anything to salvage but theres nothing the boy from district has done his job too well this idea must occur to cato too because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him the boy from district only has time to turn and run before cato catches him in a headlock from behind i can see the muscles ripple in catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the side its that quick the death of the boy from district the other two careers seem to be trying to calm cato down i can tell he wants to return to the woods but they keep pointing at the sky which pu z zles me until i reali ze of course they think whoever set off the explosions is dead they dont know about the arrows and the apples they assume the booby trap was faulty but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it if there was a cannon shot it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions the shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft they retire to the far side of the lake to allow the gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from district and they wait i suppose a cannon goes off a hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy the sun dips below the hori zon night falls up in the sky i see the seal and know the anthem must have begun a moment of darkness they show the boy from district they show the boy from district who must have died this morning then the seal reappears so now they know the bomber survived in the seals light i can see cato and the girl from district put on their night vision glasses the boy from district ignites a tree branch for a torch illuminating the grim determination on all their faces the careers stride back into the woods to hunt the di z ziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened i can hear a ringing in my right which seems a good sign theres no point in leaving my hiding place though im about as safe as i can be here at the crime scene they probably think the bomber has a two or three hour lead on them still its a long time before i risk moving the first thing i do is dig out my own glasses and put them on which relaxes me a little to have at least one of my hunters senses working i drink some water and wash the blood from my ear fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators fresh blood is bad enough i make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries rue and i gathered today where is my little ally did she make it back to the rende zvous point is she worried about me at least the sky has shown were both alive i run through the surviving tributes on my fingers the boy from both from foxface both from and just eight of us the betting must be getting really hot in the capitol theyll be doing special features on each of us now probably interviewing our friends and families its been a long time since a tribute from district made it into the top eight and now there are two of us although from what cato said peetas on his way out not that cato is the final word on anything didnt he just lose his entire stash of supplies let the seventy fourth hunger games begin cato i think let them begin for real a cold bree ze has sprung up i reach for my sleeping bag before i remember i left it with rue i was supposed to pick up another one but what with the mines and all i forgot i begin to shiver since roosting overnight in a tree isnt sensible anyway i scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles im still free zing i lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind its a little better i begin to have more sympathy for the girl from district that lit the fire that first night but now its me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning more leaves more pine needles i pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest somehow i drift off to sleep when i open my eyes the world looks slightly fractured and it takes a minute to reali ze that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision as i sit up and remove them i hear a laugh somewhere near the lake and free ze the laughs distorted but the fact that it registered at all means i must be regaining my hearing yes my right ear can hear again although its still ringing as for my left ear well at least the bleeding has stopped i peer through the bushes afraid the careers have returned trapping me here for an indefinite time no its foxface standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing shes smarter than the careers actually finding a few useful items in the ashes a metal pot a knife blade im perplexed by her amusement until i reali ze that with the careers stores eliminated she might actually stand a chance just like the rest of us it crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack but i rule it out theres something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back with that in mind this might be an excellent time to shoot her but shes
29 heard something not me because her head turns away toward the drop off and she sprints for the woods i wait no one nothing shows up still if foxface thought it was dangerous maybe its time for me to get out of here too besides im eager to tell rue about the pyramid since ive no idea where the careers are the route back by the stream seems as good as any i hurry loaded bow in one hand a hunk of cold groosling in the other because im famished now and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat the trip to the stream is uneventful once there i refill my water and wash taking particular care with my injured ear then i travel uphill using the stream as a guide at one point i find boot prints in the mud along the bank the careers have been here but not for a while the prints are deep because they were made in soft mud but now theyre nearly dry in the hot sun i havent been careful enough about my own tracks counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints now i strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream the cool water has an invigorating effect on my body my spirits i shoot two fish easy pickings in this slow moving stream and go ahead and eat one raw even though ive just had the groosling the second ill save for rue gradually subtly the ringing in my right ear diminishes until its gone entirely i find myself pawing at my left ear periodically trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds if theres improvement its undetectable i cant adjust to deafness in the ear it makes me feel off balanced and defenseless to my left blind even my head keeps turning to the injured side as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information the more time that passes the less hopeful i am that this is an injury that will heal when i reach the site of our first meeting i feel certain its been undisturbed theres no sign of rue not on the ground or in the trees this is odd by now she should have returned as its midday undoubtedly she spent the night in a tree somewhere what else could she do with no light and the careers with their night vision glasses tramping around the woods and the third fire she was supposed to set although i forgot to check for it last night was the farthest from our site of all shes probably just being cautious about making her way back i wish shed hurry because i dont want to hang around here too long i want to spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground hunting as we go but theres nothing really for me to do but wait i wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ever growing list of wounds the burns are much better but i use a bit of medicine on them anyway the main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection i go ahead andeat the second fish it isnt going to last long in this hot sun but it should be
16 easy enough to spear a few more for rue if she would just show up feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing i scale a tree to wait if the careers show up this will be a fine place to shoot them from the sun moves slowly i do things to pass the time chew leaves and apply them to my stings that are deflated
1 but still tender comb through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it lace my boots back up check over my bow and remaining nine arrows test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it but without good results despite the groosling and the fish my stomachs growling and i know im going to have what we call a hollow day back in district thats a day where no matter what you put in your belly its never enough having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse so i decide to give into it after all ive lost a lot of weight in the arena i need some extra calories and having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospects i slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts my last cracker the groosling neck thats good because it takes time to pick clean finally a groosling wing and the bird is history but its a hollow day and even with all that i start daydreaming about food particularly the decadent dishes served in the capitol the chicken in creamy orange sauce the cakes and pudding bread with butter noodles in green sauce the lamb and dried plum stew i suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over sort of dangling up in the tree with the sun warming me a mouthful of mint my bow and arrows at hand this is the most relaxed ive been since ive entered the arena if only rue would show up and we could clear out as the shadows grow so does my restlessness by late afternoon ive resolved to go looking for her i can at least visit the spot where she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts before i go i scatter a few mint leaves around our old campfire since we gathered these some distance away rue will understand ive been here while theyll mean nothing to the careers in less than an hour im at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and i know something has gone amiss the wood has been neatly arranged expertly interspersed with tinder but it has never been lit rue set up thefire but never made it back here somewhere between the second column of smoke i spied before i blew up the supplies and this point she ran into trouble i have to remind myself shes still alive or is she could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up will she appear in the sky tonight no i refuse to believe it there could be a hundred other explanations she could have lost her way run into a pack of predators or another tribute like thresh and had to hide whatever happened im almost certain shes stuck out there somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet something is keeping her up a tree i think ill go hunt it down its a relief to be doing something after sitting around
21 all afternoon i creep silently through the shadows letting them conceal me but nothing seems suspicious theres no sign of any kind of struggle no disruption of the needles on the ground ive stopped for just a moment when i hear it i have to cock my head around to the side to be sure but there it is again rues four note tune coming out of a mockingjays mouth the one that means shes all right i grin and move in the
22 direction of the bird another just a short distance ahead picks up on the handful of notes rue has been singing to them and recently otherwise theyd have taken up some other song my eyes lift up into the trees searching for a sign of her i swallow and sing softly back hoping shell know its safe to join me a mockingjay repeats the melody to me and thats when i hear the scream its a childs scream a young girls scream theres no one in the arena capable of making that sound except rue and now im running knowing this may be a trap knowing the three careers may be poised to attack me but i cant help myself theres another high pitched cry this time my name katniss katniss rue i shout back so she knows im near so they know im near and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still cant explain will be enough
6 to pull their attention away from her rue im coming when i break into the clearing shes on the ground hopelessly entangled in a net she just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her body the boy from district dies before he can pull out the spear my arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck he falls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood im reloaded shifting my aim from side to side while i shout at rue are there more are there more she has to say no several times before i hear it rue has rolled to her side her body curved in and around the spear i shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife freeing her from the net one look at the wound and i know its far beyond my capacity to heal beyond anyones probably the spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach i crouch before her staring helplessly at the embedded weapon theres no point in comforting words in telling her shell be all right shes no fool her hand reaches out and i clutch it like a lifeline as if its me whos dying instead of rue you blew up the food she whispers every last bit i say you have to win she says im going to going to win for both of us now i promise i hear a cannon and look up it must be for the boy from district dont go rue tightens her grip on my hand course not staying right here i say i move in closer to her pulling her head onto my lap i gently brush the dark thick hair back behind her ear sing she says but i barely catch the word sing i think sing what i do know a few songs believe it or not there was once music in my house too music i helped make my father pulled me in with that remarkable voice but i havent sung much since he died except when prim is very sick then i sing her the same songs she liked as a baby sing my throat is tight with tears hoarse from smoke and fatigue but if this is prims i mean rues last request i have to at least try the song that comes to me is a simple lullaby one we sing fretful hungry babies to sleep with its old very old i think made up long ago in our hills what my music teacher calls a mountain air but the words are easy and soothing promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today i give a small cough swallow hard and begin deep in the meadow under the willowa bed of grass a soft green pillowlay down your head and close your sleepy eyesand when again they open the sun will risehere its safe here its warmhere the daisies guard you from every harmhere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them truehere is the place where i love you
1 rues eyes have fluttered shut her chest moves but only slightly my throat releases the tears and they slide down my cheeks but i have to finish the song for her deep in the meadow hidden far awaya cloak of leaves a moonbeam rayforget your woes and let your troubles layand when again its morning theyll wash away here its safe here its warmhere the daisies guard you from every harm the final lines are barely audible here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them truehere is the place where i love you everythings still and quiet then almost eerily the mockingjays take up my song for a moment i sit there watching my tears drip down on her face rues cannon fires i lean forward and press my lips against her temple slowly as if not to wake her i lay her head back on the ground and release her hand theyll want me to clear out now so they can collect the bodies and theres nothing to stay for i roll the boy from district onto his face and take his pack retrieve the arrow that ended his life i cut rues pack from her back as well knowing shed want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft ive no use for a spear so the sooner its gone from the arena the better i cant stop looking at rue smaller than ever a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting i cant bring myself to leave her like this past harm but seeming utterly defenseless to hate the boy from district who also appears so vulnerable in
7 death seems inadequate its the capitol i hate for doing this to all of us gales voice is in my head his ravings against the capitol no longer pointless no longer to be ignored rues death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty the injustice they inflict upon us but here even more strongly than at home i feel my impotence theres no way to take revenge on the capitol is there then i remember peetas words on the roof only i keep wishing i could think of a way to to show the capital they dont own me that im more than just a piece in their games and for the first time i understand what he means i want to do something right here right now to shame them to make them accountable to show the capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they cant own that rue was more than a piece in their games and so am i a few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers perhaps they are really weeds of some sort but they
1 have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white i gather up an armful and come back to rues side slowly one stem at a time i decorate her body in the flowers covering the ugly wound wreathing her face weaving her hair with bright colors theyll have to show it or even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment theyll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know i did it i step back and take a last look at rue she could really be asleep in that meadow after all bye rue i whisper i press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction then i walk away without looking back the birds fall silent somewhere a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft i dont know how it knows it must hear things that humans cant i pause my eyes focused on whats ahead not whats happening behind me it doesnt take long then the general birdsong begins again and i know shes gone another mockingjay a young one by the look of it lands on a branch before me and bursts out rues melody my song the hovercraft were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up but it has mastered her handful of notes the ones that mean shes safe good and safe i say as i pass under its branch we dont have to worry about her now good and safe ive no idea where to go the brief sense of home i had that one night with rue has vanished my feet wander this way and that until sunset im not afraid not even watchful which makes me an easy target except id kill anyone i met on sight without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands my hatred of the capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least especially the careers they at
12 least can be made to pay for rues death no one materiali zes though there arent many of us left and its a big arena soon theyll be pulling out some other device to force us together but theres been enough gore today perhaps well even get to sleep im about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me a gift from a sponsor but why now ive been in fairly good shape with supplies maybe haymitchs noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit or could it be something to help my ear i open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread its not the fine white capitol stuff its made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent sprinkled with seeds i flash back to peetas lesson on the various district breads in the training center this bread came from district i cautiously lift the still warm loaf what must it have cost the people of district who cant even feed themselves how many wouldve had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf it had been meant for rue surely but instead of pulling the gift when she died theyd authori zed haymitch to give it to me as a thank you or because like me they dont like to let debts go unpaid for whatever reason this is a first a district gift to a tribute whos not your own i lift my face and step into the last falling rays of sunlight my thanks to the people of district eleven i say i want them to know i know where it came from that the full value of their gift has been recogni zed i climb dangerously high into a tree not for safety but to get as far away from today as i can my sleeping bag is rolled neatly in rues pack tomorrow ill sort through the supplies tomorrow ill make a new plan but tonight all i can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread its good it tastes of home soon the seals in the sky the anthem plays in my right ear i see the boy from district rue thats all for tonight six of us left i think only six with the bread still locked in my hands i fall asleep at once sometimes when things are particularly bad my brain will give me a happy dream a visit with my father in the woods an hour of sunlight and cake with prim tonight it sends me rue still decked in her flowers perched in a high sea of trees trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays
10 i see no sign of her wounds no blood just a bright laughing girl she sings songs ive never heard in a clear melodic voice on and on through the night theres a drowsy in between period when i can hear the last few strains of her music although shes lost in the leaves when i fully awaken im momentarily comforted i try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream but it quickly slips away leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever heaviness infuses my whole body as if theres liquid lead in my veins ive lost the will to do the simplest tasks to do anything but lie here staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves for several hours i remain motionless as usual its the thought
18 of prims anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy i give myself a series of simple commands to follow like now you have to sit up katniss now you have to drink water katniss i act on the orders with slow robotic motions now you have to sort the packs katniss rues pack holds my sleeping bag her nearly empty water skin a handful of nuts and roots a bit of rabbit her extra socks and her slingshot the boy from district has several knives two spare spearheads a flashlight a small leather pouch a first aid kit a full bottle of water and a pack of dried fruit a pack of dried fruit out of all he might have chosen from to me this is a sign of extreme arrogance why
26 bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp when you will kill your enemies so quickly youll be home before youre hungry i can only hope the other careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing speaking of which my own supply is running low i finish off the loaf from district and the last of the rabbit how quickly the food disappears all i have left are rues roots and nuts the boys dried fruit and one strip of beef now you have to hunt katniss i tell myself i obediently consolidate the supplies i want into my pack after i climb down the tree i conceal the boys knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them ive lost my bearings what with all the wandering around i did yesterday evening but i try and head back in the general direction of the stream i know im on course when i come across rues third unlit fire shortly thereafter i discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them i return to rues signal fire and start it up not caring about the excessive smoke where are you cato i think as i roast the birds and rues roots im waiting right here who knows where the careers are now either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or is it possible too scared of me they know i have the bow and arrows of course cato saw me take them from glimmers body but have they put two and two together yet figured out i blew up the supplies and killed their fellow career possibly they think thresh did this wouldnt he be more likely to revenge
17 rues death than i would being from the same district not that he ever took any interest in her and what about foxface did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies no when i caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise i doubt they think peeta has lit this signal fire catos sure hes as good as dead i find myself wishing i could tell peeta about the flowers i put on rue that i now understand what he was trying to say on the roof perhaps if he wins the games hell see me on victors night when they replay the highlights of the games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews the winner sits in a place of honor on the platform surrounded by their support crew but i told rue id be there for both of us and somehow that seems even more important than the vow i gave prim i really think i stand a chance of doing it now winning its not just having the arrows or outsmarting the careers a few times although those things help something happened when i was holding rues hand watching the life drain out of her now i am determined to revenge her to make her loss unforgettable and i can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable i overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot but no one does maybe the other tributes are out there beating one another senseless which would be fine ever since the bloodbath ive been featured on screens most than i care eventually i wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some but the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me and even though its only early evening i climb a tree and settle in for the night my brain begins to replay the events from yesterday i keep seeing rue speared my arrow piercing the boys neck i dont know why i should even care about the boy then i reali ze he was my first kill along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets every tribute has a list of kills i guess technically id get credited for glimmer and the girl from district too for dumping that nest on them but the boy from district was the first person i knew would die because of my actionsnumerous animals have lost their lives at my hands but only one human i hear gale saying how different can it be really ama zingly similar in the execution a bow pulled an arrow shot entirely different in the aftermath i killed a boy whose name i dont even know somewhere his family is weeping for him his friends call for my blood maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back but then i think of rues still body and im able to banish the boy from my mind at least for now its been an uneventful day according to the sky no deaths i wonder how long well get until the next catastrophe drives us back together if its going to be tonight i want to get some sleep first i cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem but then i hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation for the most part the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll but occasionally there will be trumpets followed by an announcement usually this will be a call to a feast when food is scarce the gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet somewhere known to all like the cornucopia as an inducement to gather and fight sometimes there is a feast and sometimes theres nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for i wouldnt go in for the food but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors claudius templesmiths voice booms down from overhead congratulating the six of us who remain but he is not inviting us to a feast hes saying something very confusing
23 theres been a rule change in the games a rule change that in itself is mind bending since we dont really have any rules to speak of except dont step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another under the new rule both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive claudius pauses as if he knows were not getting it and repeats the change again the news sinks in two tributes can win this year if theyre from the same district both can live both of us can live before i can stop myself i call out peetas name part iiithe victor i clap my hands over my mouth but the sound has already escaped the sky goes black and i hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing stupid i tell myself what a stupid thing to do i wait fro zen for the woods to come alive with assailants then i remember theres almost no one left peeta whos been wounded is now my ally whatever doubts ive had about him dissipate because if either of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when we returned to district in fact i know if i was watching id loathe any tribute who didnt immediately ally with their district partner besides it just makes sense to protect each other and in my case being one of the star crossed lovers from district its an absolute requirement if i want any more help from sympathetic sponsors the star crossed lovers peeta must have been playing that angle all along why else would the gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules for two tributes to have a shot at winning our romance must be so popular with the audience that condemning
2 it would jeopardi ze the success of the games no thanks to me all ive done is managed not to kill peeta but whatever hes done in the arena he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive shaking his head to keep me from running to the cornucopia fighting cato to let me escape even hooking up with the careers must have been a move to protect me peeta it turns out has never been a danger to me the thought makes me smile i drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it so who is there left to be afraid of foxface the boy tribute from her district is dead shes operating alone at night and her strategy has been to evade not attack i dont really think that even if she heard my voice shed do anything but hope someone else would kill me then theres thresh all right hes a distinct threat but i havent seen him not once since the games began i think about how foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion but she didnt turn to the woods she turned to whatever lies across from it to that area of the arena that drops off into i dont know what i feel almost certain that the person she ran from was thresh and that is his domain hed never have heard me from there and even if he did im up too high for someone his si ze to reach so that leaves cato and the girl from district who are now surely celebrating the new rule theyre the only ones left who benefit from it besides peeta and myself do i run from them now on the chance they heard me call peetas name no i think let them come let them come with their night vision glasses and their heavy branch breaking bodies right into the range of my arrows but i know they wont if they didnt come in daylight to my fire they wont risk what could be another trap at night when they come it will be on their own terms not because ive let them know my whereabouts stay put and get some sleep katniss i instruct myself although i wish i could start tracking peeta now tomorrow youll find him i do sleep but in the morning im extra cautious thinking that while the careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree theyre completely capable of setting an ambush for me i make sure to fully prepare myself for the day eating a big breakfast securing my pack readying my weapons before i descend but all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground today ill have to be scrupulously careful the careers will know im trying to locate peeta they may well want to wait until i do before they move in if hes as badly wounded as cato thinks id be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance but if hes that incapacitated how has he managed to stay alive and how on earth will i find him i try to think of anything peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where hes hiding out but nothing rings a bell so i go back to the last moment i saw him sparkling in the sunlight yelling at me to run then cato appeared his sword drawn and after i was gone he wounded peeta but how did peeta get away maybe hed held out better against the tracker jacker poison than cato maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape but hed been stung too so how far could he have gotten stabbed and filled with venom and how has he stayed alive all these days since if the wound and the stingers havent killed him surely thirst would have taken him by now and thats when i get my first clue to his whereabouts he couldnt have survived without water i know that from my first few days here he must be hidden somewhere near a source theres the lake but i find that an unlikely option since its so close to the careers base camp a few spring fed pools but youd really be a sitting duck at one of those and the stream the one that leads from the camp rue and i made all the way down near the lake and beyond if he stuck to the stream he could change his location and always be near water he could walk in the current and erase any tracks he might even be able to get a fish or two well its a place to start anyway to confuse my enemies minds i start a fire with plenty of green wood even if they think its a ruse i hope theyll decide im hidden somewhere near it while in reality ill be tracking peeta the sun burns off the morning ha ze almost immediately and i can tell the day will be hotter than usual the waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet as i head downstream im tempted to call out peetas name as i go but decide against it i will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me but hell know ill be looking right he wont have so low of an opinion of me as to think id ignore the new rule and keep to myself would he
30 hes very hard to predict which might be interesting under different circumstances but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle it doesnt take long to reach the spot where i peeled off to go the careers camp theres been no sign of peeta but this doesnt surprise me ive been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident if he were nearby surely id have had some suspicion of it the stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods thats new to me muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in si ze until i begin to feel somewhat trapped it would be no small matter to escape the stream now fighting off cato or thresh as i climbed over this rocky terrain in fact ive just about decided im on the wrong track entirely that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source when i see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder its long dried now but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties tried to wipe it away hugging the rocks i move slowly in the direction of the blood searching for him i find a few more bloodstains one with a few threads of fabric glued to it but no sign of life i break down and say his name in a hushed voice peeta peeta then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones so i stop i give up and climb back down to the stream thinking he must have moved on somewhere farther down my foot has just broken the surface of the water when i hear a voice you here to finish me off sweetheart i whip around its come from the left so i cant pick it up very well and the voice was hoarse and weak still it must have been peeta who else in the arena would call me sweetheart my eyes peruse the bank but theres nothing just mud the plants the base of the rocks peeta i whisper where are you theres no answer could i just have imagined it no im certain it was real and very close at hand too peeta i creep along the bank well dont step on me i jump back his voice was right under my feet still theres nothing then his eyes open unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves i gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs its the final word in camouflage forget chucking weights around peeta should have gone into his private session with the gamemakers and
20 painted himself into a tree or a boulder or a muddy bank full of weeds close your eyes again i order he does and his mouth too and completely disappears most of what i judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants his face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible i kneel beside him i guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off peeta smiles yes frosting the final defense of the dying youre not going to die i tell him firmly says who his voice is so ragged says me were on the same team now you know i tell him his eyes open so i heard nice of you to find whats left of me i pull out my water bottle and give him a drink did cato cut you i ask left leg up high he answers lets get you in the stream wash you off so i can see what kind of wounds youve got i say lean down a minute first he says need to tell you something i lean over and put my good ear to his lips which tickle as he whispers remember were madly in love so its all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it i jerk my head back but end up laughing thanks ill keep it in mind at least hes still able to joke around but when i start to help him to the stream all the levity disappears its only two feet away how hard can it be very hard when i reali ze hes unable to move an inch on his own hes so weak that the best he can do is not to resist i try to drag him but despite the fact that i know hes doing all he can to keep quiet sharp cries of pain escape him the mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and i finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches hes still two feet from the water lying there teeth gritted tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face look peeta im going to roll you into the stream its very shallow here okay i say excellent he says i crouch down beside him no matter what happens i tell myself dont stop until hes in the water on three i say one two three i can only manage one full roll before i have to stop because of the horrible sound hes making now hes on the edge of the stream maybe this is better anyway okay change of plans im not going to put you all the way in i tell him besides if i get him in who knows if id ever be able to get him out no more rolling he asks thats all done lets get you cleaned up keep an eye on the woods for me okay i say its hard to know where to start he so caked with mud and matted leaves i cant even see his clothes if hes wearing clothes the thought makes me hesitate a moment but then i plunge in naked bodies are no big deal in the arena right ive got two water bottles and rues water skin i prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while i pour the third over peetas body it takes a while but i finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes i gently un zip his jacket unbutton his shirt and ease them off him his undershirt is so plastered into his wounds i have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work it loose hes badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings if you count the one under his ear but i feel a bit better this much i can fix i decide to take care of his upper body first to alleviate some pain before i tackle whatever damage cato did to his leg since treating his wounds seems pointless when hes lying in whats
20 become a mud puddle i manage to prop him up against a boulder he sits there uncomplaining while i wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin his flesh is very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and stocky i have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps which causes him to wince but the minute i apply the leaves he sighs in relief while he dries in the sun i wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders then i apply the burn cream to his chest this is when i notice how hot his skin is becoming the layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that hes burning with fever i dig through the first aid kit i got from the boy from district and find pills that reduce your temperature my mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail swallow these i tell him and he obediently takes the medicine you must be hungry not really its funny i havent been hungry for days says peeta in fact when i offer him groosling he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away thats when i know how sick he is peeta we need to get some food in you i insist itll just come right back up he says the best i can do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple thanks im much better really can i sleep now katniss he asks soon i promise i need to look at your leg first trying to be as gentle as i can i remove his boots his socks and then very slowly inch his pants off of him i can see the tear catos sword made in the fabric over his thigh but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath the deep inflamed gash oo zing both blood and pus the swelling of the leg and worst of all the smell of festering flesh i want to run away disappear into the woods like i did that day they brought the burn victim to our house go and hunt while my mother and prim attend to what i have neither the skill nor the courage to face but theres no one here but me i try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases pretty awful huh says peeta hes watching me closely so so i shrug like its no big deal you should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines i refrain from saying how i usually clear out of the house whenever shes treating anything worse than a cold come to think of it i dont even much like to be around coughing first thing is to clean it well ive left on peetas undershorts because theyre not in bad shape and i dont want to pull them over the swollen thigh and all right maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable thats another thing about my mother and prim nakedness has no effect on them gives them no cause for embarrassment ironically at this point in the games my little sister would be of far more use to peeta than i am i scoot my square of plastic under him so i can wash down the rest of him with each bottle i pour over him the worse the wound looks the rest of his lower body has fared pretty well just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that i treat quickly but the gash on his leg what on earth can i do for that why dont we give it some air and then i trail off and then youll patch it up says peeta he looks almost sorry for me as if he knows how lost i am thats right i say in the meantime you eat these i put a few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes when theyre flattened out and drying i examine the contents of the first aid kit its pretty basic stuff bandages fever pills medicine to calm stomachs nothing of the caliber ill need to treat peeta were going to have to experiment some i admit i know the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection so i start with those within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed up green stuff into the wound pus begins running down the side of his leg i tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance katniss peeta says i meet his eyes knowing my face must be some shade of green he mouths the words how about that kiss i burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting i cant stand it something wrong he asks a little too innocently i im no good at this im not my mother ive no idea what im doing and i hate pus i say euh i allow myself to let out a groan as i rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second euuuh how do you hunt he asks trust me killing things is much easier than this i say although for all i know i am killing you can you speed it up a little he asks no shut up and eat your pears i say after three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus the wound does look better now that the swelling has gone down i can see how deep catos sword cut right down to the bone what next dr everdeen he asks maybe ill put some of the burn ointment on it i think it helps with infection anyway and wrap it up i say i do and the whole thing seems a lot more manageable covered in clean white cotton although against the sterile bandage the hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion i
6 pull out rues backpack here cover yourself with this and ill wash your shorts oh i dont care if you see me says peeta youre just like the rest of my family i say i care all right i turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts splash into the current he must be feeling a bit better if he can throw you know youre kind of squeamish for such a lethal person says peeta as i beat the shorts clean between two rocks i wish id let you give haymitch a shower after all i wrinkle my nose at the memory whats he sent you so far not a thing says peeta then theres a pause as it hits him why did you get something burn medicine i say almost sheepishly oh and some bread i always knew you were his favorite says peeta please he cant stand being in the same room with me i say because youre just alike mutters peeta i ignore it though because this really isnt the time for me to be insulting haymitch which is my first impulse i let peeta do ze off while his clothes dry out but by late afternoon i dont dare wait any longer i gently shake his shoulder peeta weve got to go now go he seems confused go where away from here downstream maybe somewhere we can hide you until youre stronger i say i help him dress leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the water and pull him upright his face drains of color the moment he puts weight on his leg come on you can do this but he cant not for long anyway we make it about fifty yards downstream with him propped up by my shoulder and i can tell hes going to black out i sit him on the bank push his head between his knees and pat his back awkwardly as i survey the area of course id love to get him up in a tree but thats not going to happen it could be worse though some of the rocks form small cavelike structures i set my sights on one about twenty yards above the stream when peetas able to stand i half guide half carry him up to the cave really id like to look around for a better place but this one will have to do because my ally is shot paper white panting and even though its only just cooling off hes shivering i cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles unroll my sleeping bag and tuck him into it i get a couple of pills and some water into him when hes not noticing but he refuses to eat even the fruit then he just lies there his eyes trained on my face as i build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the mouth of the cave the result is unsatisfactory an animal might not question it but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough i tear it down in frustration katniss he says i go over to him and brush the hair back from his eyes thanks for finding me you would have found me if you could i say his foreheads
6 burning up like the medicines having no effect at all suddenly out of nowhere im scared hes going to die yes look if i dont make it back he begins dont talk like that i didnt drain all that pus for nothing i say i know but just in case i dont he tries to continue no peeta i dont even want to discuss it i say placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him but i he insists impulsively i lean forward and kiss him stopping his words this is probably overdue anyway since hes right we are supposed to be madly in love its the first time ive ever kissed a boy which should make some sort of impression i guess but all i can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever i break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up around him youre not going to die i forbid it all right all right he whispers i step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute floats down from the sky my fingers quickly undo the tie hoping for some real medicine to treat peetas leg instead i find a pot of hot broth haymitch couldnt be sending me a clearer message one kiss equals one pot of broth i can almost hear his snarl youre supposed to be in love sweetheart the boys dying give me something i can work with and hes right if i want to keep peeta alive ive got to give the audience something more to care about star crossed lovers desperate to get home together two hearts beating as one romance never having been in love this is going to be a real trick i think of my parents the way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods the way my mothers face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door the way she almost stopped living when he died peeta i say trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father hes do zed off again but i kiss him awake which seems to startle him then he smiles as if hed be happy to lie there ga zing at me forever hes great at this stuff i hold up the pot peeta look what haymitch has sent you getting the broth into peeta takes an hour of coaxing begging threatening and yes kissing but finally sip by sip he empties the pot i let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots while i watch the daily report in the sky no new casualties still peeta and i have given the audience a fairly interesting day hopefully the gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night i automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before i reali ze thats over at least for a while i cant very well leave peeta unguarded on the ground i left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched how could i conceal it and were a scant fifty yards downstream i put on my glasses place my weapons in readiness and settle down to keep watch the temperature drops rapidly and soon im chilled to the bone eventually i give in and slide into the sleeping bag with peeta its toasty warm and i snuggle down gratefully until i reali ze its more than warm its overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever i check his forehead and find it burning and dry i dont know what to do leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the fever take him out and hope the night air cools him off i end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead it seems weak but im afraid to do anything too drastic i spend the night half sitting half lying next to peeta refreshing the bandage and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him ive made myself far more vulnerable than when i was alone tethered to the ground
9 on guard with a very sick person to take care of but i knew he was injured and still i came after him im just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one when the sky turns rosy i notice the sheen of sweat on peetas lip and discover the fever has broken hes not back to normal but its come down a few degrees last night when i was gathering vines i came upon a bush of rues berries i strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water peetas struggling to get up when i reach the cave i woke up and you were gone he says i was worried about you i have to laugh as i ease him back down you were worried about me have you taken a look at yourself lately i thought cato and clove might have found you they like to hunt at night he says still serious clove which one is that i ask the girl from district two shes still alive right he says yes theres just them and us and thresh and foxface i say thats what i nicknamed the girl from five how do you feel better than yesterday this is an enormous improvement over the mud he says clean clothes and medicine and a sleeping bag and you oh right the whole romance thing i reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips i remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and i wonder where peeta picked it up surely not from his father and the witch no more kisses for you until youve eaten i say we get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush i feed him he refuses the groosling again though you didnt sleep peeta says im all right i say but the truth is im exhausted sleep now ill keep watch ill wake you if anything happens he says i hesitate katniss you cant stay up forever hes got a point there ill have to sleep eventually and probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side all right i say but just for a few hours
27 then you wake me its too warm for the sleeping bag now i smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down one hand on my loaded bow in case i have to shoot at a moments notice peeta sits beside me leaning against the wall his bad leg stretched
6 out before him his eyes trained on the world outside go to sleep he says softly his hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far this gesture seems natural and comforting i dont want him to stop and he doesnt hes still stroking my hair when i fall asleep too long i sleep too long i know from the moment i open my eyes that were into the afternoon peetas right beside me his position unchanged i sit up feeling somehow defensive but better rested than ive been in days peeta you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours i say for what nothings going on here he says besides i like watching you sleep you dont scowl improves your looks a lot this of course brings on a scowl that makes him grin thats when i notice how dry his lips are i test his cheek hot as a coal stove he claims hes been drinking
2 but the containers still feel full to me i give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one then a second quart of water then i tend to his minor wounds the burns the stings which are showing improvement i steel myself and unwrap the leg my heart drops into my stomach its worse much worse theres no more pus in evidence but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed then i see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg blood poisoning unchecked it will kill him for sure my chewed up leaves and ointment wont make a dent in it well need strong anti infection drugs from the capitol i cant imagine the cost of such potent medicine if haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor would he have enough i doubt it gifts go up in price the longer the games continue what buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve and the kind of medicine peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning well theres more swelling but the pus is gone i say in an unsteady voice i know what blood poisoning is katniss says peeta even if my mother isnt a healer youre just going to have to outlast the others peeta theyll cure it back at the capitol when we win i say yes thats a good plan he says but i feel this is mostly for my benefit you have to eat keep your strength up im going to make you soup i say dont light a fire he says its not worth it well see i say as i take the pot down to the stream im struck by how brutally hot it is i swear the gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night the heat of the sun baked stones by the stream gives me an idea though maybe i wont need to light a fire i settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave after purifying half a pot of water i place it in direct sunlight and add several egg si ze hot stones to the water im the first to admit im not much of a cook but since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting its one of my better dishes i mince groosling until its practically mush and mash some of rues roots fortunately theyve both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up already between the sunlight and the rocks the waters warm i put in the meat and roots swap in fresh rocks and go find something green to spice it up a little before long i discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks perfect i chop them very fine and add them to the pot switch out the rocks again put on the lid and let the whole thing stew ive seen very few signs of game around but i dont feel comfortable leaving peeta alone while i hunt so i rig half a do zen snares and hope i get lucky i wonder about the other tributes how theyre managing now that their main source of food has been blown up at least three of them cato
13 clove and foxface had been relying on it probably not thresh though ive got a feeling he must share some of rues knowledge on how to feed yourself from the earth are they fighting each other looking for us maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack the idea sends me back to the cave peetas stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks although he brightens a bit when i come in its clear he feels miserable i put cool cloths on his head but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin do you want anything i ask no he says thank you wait yes tell me a story a story what about i say im not much for storytelling its kind of like singing but once in a while prim wheedles one out of me something happy tell me about the happiest day you can remember says peeta something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves my mouth a happy story this will require a lot more effort than the soup i rack my brains for good memories most of them involve gale and me out hunting and somehow i dont think these will play well with either peeta or the audience that leaves prim did i ever tell you about how i got prims goat i ask peeta shakes his head and looks at me expectantly so i begin but carefully because my words are going out all over panem and while people have no doubt put two and two together that i hunt illegally i dont want to hurt gale or greasy sae or the butcher or even the peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing theyd breaking the law too heres the real story of how i got the money for prims goat lady it was a friday evening the day before prims tenth birthday in late may as soon as school ended gale and i hit the woods because i wanted to get enough to trade for a present for prim maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens but this was really no more than our average friday night haul i was disappointed as we headed back even though gale said wed be sure to do better tomorrow we were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him a young
29 buck probably a yearling by his si ze his antlers were just growing in still small and coated in velvet poised to run but unsure of us unfamiliar with humans beautiful less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him one in the neck the other in the chest gale and i had shot at the same time the buck tried to run but stumbled and gales knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened momentarily id felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent and then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that fresh and innocent meat a deer gale and i have only brought down three in all the first one a doe that had injured her leg somehow almost didnt count but we knew from that experience not to go dragging the carcass into the hob it had caused chaos with people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces themselves greasy sae had intervened and sent us with our deer to the butcher but not before itd been badly damaged hunks of meat taken the hide riddled with holes although everybody paid up fairly it had lowered the value of the kill this time we waited until dark fell and slipped under a hole in the fence close to the butcher even though we were known hunters it wouldnt have been good to go carrying a pound deer through the streets of district in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials faces the butcher a short chunky woman named rooba came to the back door when we knocked you dont haggle with rooba she gives you one price which you can take or leave but its a fair price we took her offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison steaks we could pick up after the butchering even with the money divided in two neither gale nor i had held so much at one time in our lives we decided to keep it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money at the end of the next day this is where i really got the money for the goat but i tell peeta i sold an old silver locket of my mothers that cant hurt anyone then i pick up the story in the late afternoon of prims birthday gale and i went to the market on the square so that i could buy dress materials as i was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth something caught my eye theres an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the seam i dont know his real name everyone just calls him the goat man his joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles and hes got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines but hes lucky somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death hes filthy and impatient but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it one of the goats a white one with black patches was lying down in a cart it was easy to see why something probably a dog had mauled her shoulder and infection had set in it was bad the goat man had to hold her up to milk her but i thought i knew someone who could fix it gale i whispered i want that goat for prim owning a nanny goat can
25 change your life in district the animals can live off almost anything the meadows a perfect feeding place and they can give four quarts of milk a day to drink to make into cheese to sell its not even against
19 the law shes hurt pretty bad said gale we better take a closer look we went over and bought a cup of milk to share then stood over the goat as if idly curious let her be said the man just looking said gale well look fast she goes to the butcher soon hardly anyone will buy her milk and then they only pay half price said the man whats the butcher giving for her i asked the man shrugged hang around and see i turned and saw rooba coming across the square toward us lucky thing you showed up said the goat man when she arrived girls got her eye on your goat not if shes spoken for i said carelessly rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat shes not look at that shoulder bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage what said the goat man we had a deal we had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks not that thing sell her to the girl if shes stupid enough to take her said rooba as she marched off i caught her wink the goat man was mad but he still wanted that goal off his hands it took us half an hour to agree on the price quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions it was an excellent deal if the goat lived id been robbed if she died people took sides in the argument but i took the goat gale offered to carry her i think he wanted to see the look on prims face as much as i did in a moment of complete giddiness i bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck then we hurried back to my house you should have seen prims reaction when we walked in with that goat remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat buttercup she was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once my mother was less sure seeing the injury but the pair of them went to work on it grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animals throat they sound like you says peeta i had almost forgotten he was there oh no peeta they work magic that thing couldnt have died if it tried i say but then i bite my tongue reali zing what that must sound like to peeta who is dying in my incompetent hands dont worry im not trying he jokes finish the story well thats it only i remember that night prim insisted on sleeping with lady on a blanket next to the fire and just before they drifted off the goat licked her cheek like it was giving her a good night kiss or something i say it was already mad about her was it still wearing the pink ribbon he asks i think so i say why im just trying to get a picture he says thoughtfully i can see why that day made you happy well i knew that goat would be a little gold mine say yes of course i was referring to that not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping says peeta drily the goat has paid for itself several times over i say in a superior tone well it wouldnt dare do anything else after you saved its life says peeta i intend to do the same thing really what did you cost me again i ask a lot of trouble dont worry youll get it all back he says youre not making sense i say i test his forehead the levers going nowhere but up youre a little cooler though the sound of the trumpets startles me im on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash not wanting to miss a syllable its my new best friend claudius templesmith and as i expected hes inviting us to a feast well were not that hungry and i actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says now hold on some of you may already be declining my invitation but this is no ordinary feast each of you needs something desperately i do need something desperately something to heal peetas leg each of you will find
5 that something in a backpack marked with your district number at the cornucopia at dawn think hard about refusing to show up for some of you this will be your last chance says claudius theres nothing else just his words hanging in the air i jump as peeta grips my shoulder from behind no he says youre not risking your life for me who said i was i say so youre not going he asks of course im not going give me some credit do you think im running straight into some free for all against cato and clove and thresh dont be stupid i say helping him back to bed ill let them fight it out well see whos in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there youre such a bad liar katniss i dont know how youve survived this long he begins to mimic me i knew that goat would be a little gold mine youre a little cooler though of course im not going he shakes his head never gamble at cards youll lose your last coin he says anger flushes my face all right i am going and you cant stop me i can follow you at least partway i may not make it to the cornucopia but if im yelling your name i bet someone can find me and then ill be dead for sure he says you wont get a hundred yards from here on that leg i say then ill drag myself says peeta you go and im going too hes just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to do it come howling after me in the woods even if a tribute doesnt find him something else might he cant defend himself id probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself and who knows what the exertion will do to him what am i supposed to do sit here and watch you die i say he must know thats not an option that the audience would hate me and frankly i would hate myself too if i didnt even try i wont die i promise if you promise not to go he says were at something of a stalemate i know i cant argue him out of this one so i dont try i pretend reluctantly to go along then you have to do what i say drink your water wake me when i tell you and eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it is i snap at him agreed is it ready he asks wait here i say the airs gone cold even though the suns still up im right about the gamemakers messing with the temperature i wonder if the thing someone needs desperately is a good blanket the soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot and actually doesnt taste too bad peeta eats without complaint even scraping out the pot to show his enthusiasm he rambles on about how delicious it is which should be encouraging if you dont know what fever does to people hes like listening to haymitch before the alcohol has soaked him into incoherence i give him another dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely as i go down to the stream to wash up all i can think is that hes going to die if i dont get to that feast ill keep him going for a day or two and then the infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs and hell be gone and ill be here all alone again waiting for the others im so lost in thought that i almost miss the parachute even though it floats right by me then i spring after it yanking it from the water tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial haymitch has done it hes gotten the medicine i dont know how persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels and i can save peeta its such a tiny vial though it must be very strong to cure someone as ill as peeta a ripple of doubt runs through me i uncork the vial and take a deep sniff my spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent just to be sure i place a drop on the tip of my tongue theres no question its sleep syrup its a common medicine in district cheap as medicine goes but very addictive almost everyones had a dose at one time or another we have some in a bottle at home my mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night it only takes a little a vial this si ze could knock peeta out for a full day but what good is that im so furious im about to throw haymitchs last offering into the stream when it hits me a full day thats more than i need i mash up a handful of berries so the taste wont be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure then i head back up to the cave ive brought you a treat i found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation he swallows then frowns slightly theyre very sweet yes theyre sugar berries my mother makes jam from them havent you ever had them before i say poking the next spoonful in his mouth no he says almost pu z zled but they taste familiar sugar berries well you cant get them in the market much they only grow wild i say another mouthful goes down just one more to go theyre sweet as syrup he says taking the last spoonful syrup his eyes widen as he reali zes the truth i clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard forcing him to swallow instead of spit he tries to make himself vomit the stuff up but its too late hes already losing consciousness even as he fades away i can see in his eyes what ive done is unforgivable i sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction a stray berry stains his chin and i wipe it away who cant lie peeta i say even though he cant hear me it doesnt matter the rest of panem can in the remaining hours before nightfall i gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening
24 of the cave its a slow and arduous process but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around im pretty pleased with my work the cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks like so many in the vicinity i can still crawl in to peeta through a small opening but its undetectable from the out side thats good because ill need to share that sleeping bag again tonight also if i dont make it back from the feast peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned although i doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine if i die at the feast district isnt likely to have a victor i make a meal out of the smaller bonier fish that inhabit the stream down here fill every water container and purify it and clean my weapons ive nine arrows left in all i debate leaving the knife with peeta so hell have some protection while im gone but theres really no point he was right about camouflage being his final defense but i still might have use for the knife who knows what ill encounter here are some things im fairly certain of that at least cato clove and thresh will be on hand when the feast starts im not sure about foxface since direct confrontation isnt her style or her forte shes even smaller than i am and unarmed unless shes picked up some weapons recently shell probably be hanging somewhere nearby seeing what she can scavenge but the other three im going to have my hands full my ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset but i know ill have to go right into the thick of things to get that backpack the one with the number on it that claudius templesmith mentioned i watch the sky hoping for one less opponent at dawn but nobody appears tonight tomorrow there will be faces up there feasts always result in fatalities i crawl into the cave secure my glasses and curl up next to peeta luckily i had that good long sleep today i have to stay awake i dont really think anyone will attack our cave tonight but i cant risk missing the dawn so cold so bitterly cold tonight as if the gamemakers have sent an infusion of fro zen air across the arena which may be exactly what theyve done i lay next to peeta in the bag trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat its strange to be so physically close to someone whos so distant peeta might as well be back in the capitol or in district or on the moon right now hed be no harder to reach ive never felt lonelier since the games began just accept it will be a bad night i tell myself i try not to but i cant help thinking of my mother and prim wondering if theyll sleep a wink tonight at this late stage in the games with an important event like the feast school will probably be canceled my family can either watch on that static filled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square to watch on the big clear screens theyll have privacy at home but support in the square people will give them a kind word a bit of food if they can spare it i wonder if the baker has sought them out especially now that peeta and i are a team and made good on his promise to keep my sisters belly full spirits must be running high in district we so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the games surely people are excited about peeta and me especially now that were together if i close my eyes i can imagine their shouts at the screens urging us on i see their faces greasy sac and madge and even the peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for us and gale i know him he wont be shouting and cheering but hell be watching every
11 moment every twist and turn and willing me to come home i wonder if hes hoping that peeta makes it as well gales not my boyfriend but would he be if i opened that door he talked about us running away together was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district or something more i wonder what he makes of all this kissing through a crack in the rocks i watch the moon cross the sky at what i judge to be about three hours before dawn i begin final preparations im careful to leave peeta with water and the medical kit right beside him nothing else will be of much use if i dont return and even these would only prolong his life a short time after some debate i strip him of his jacket and zip it on over my own he doesnt need it not now in the sleeping bag with his fever and during the day if im not there to remove it hell be roasting in it my hands are already stiff from cold so i take rues spare pair of socks cut holes for my fingers and thumbs and pull them on it helps anyway i fill her small pack with some food a water bottle and bandages tuck the knife in my belt get my bow and arrows im about to leave when i remember the importance of sustaining the star crossed lover routine and i lean over and give peeta a long lingering kiss i imagine the teary sighs emanating from the capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own then i squee ze through the opening in the rocks out into the night my breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air its as cold as a november night at home one where ive slipped into the woods lantern in hand to join gale at some prearranged place where well sit bundled together sipping herb tea from metal flasks wrapped in quilting hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on oh gale i think if only you had my back now i move as fast as i dare the glasses are quite remarkable but i still sorely miss having the use of my left ear i dont know what the explosion did but it damaged something deep and irreparable never mind if i get home ill be so stinking rich ill be able to pay someone to do my hearing the woods always look different at night even with the glasses everything
11 has an unfamiliar slant to it as if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their places i dont try anything tricky like taking a new route i make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to rues hiding place near the lake along the way i see no sign of another tribute not a puff of breath not a quiver of a branch either im the first to arrive or the others positioned themselves last night theres still more than an hour maybe two when i wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to flow i chew a few mint leaves my stomach isnt up for much more thank goodness i have peetas jacket as well as my own if not id be forced to move around to stay warm the sky turns a misty morning gray and still theres no sign of the other tributes its not surprising really everyone has distinguished themselves either by strength or deadliness or cunning do they suppose i wonder that i have peeta with me i doubt foxface and thresh even know he was wounded all the better if they think hes covering me when i go in for the backpack but where is it the arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses i can hear the morning birds singing isnt it time for a second im panicked that im at the wrong location but no im certain i remember claudius templesmith specifying the cornucopia and there it is and here i am so wheres my feast just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold cornucopia theres a disturbance on the plain the ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a snowy white cloth rises into the arena on the table sit four backpacks two large black ones with the numbers and a medium si ze green one with the number and a tiny orange one really i could carry it around my wrist that must be marked with a the table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out of the cornucopia snags the green backpack and speeds off foxface leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea the rest of us are still poised around the plain si zing up the situation and shes got hers shes got us trapped too because no one wants to chase her down not while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table foxface must have purposefully left the other packs alone knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer that should have been my strategy by the lime ive worked through the emotions of surprise admiration anger jealousy and frustration im watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range huh im always dreading the others but maybe foxface is the real opponent here shes cost me time
1 too because by now its clear that i must get to the table next anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone without hesitation i sprint for the table i can sense the emergence of danger before i see it fortunately the first knife comes whi z zing in on my right side so i can hear it and im able to deflect it with my bow i turn drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at cloves heart she turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit but the point punctures her upper left arm unfortunately she throws with her right but its enough to slow her down a few moments having to pull the arrow from her arm take in the severity of the wound i keep moving positioning the next arrow automatically as only someone who has hunted for years can do im at the table now my fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack my hand slips between the straps and i yank it up on my arm its really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy and im turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead it slices above my right eyebrow opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face blinding my eye filling my mouth with the sharp metallic taste of my own blood i stagger backward but still manage to send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant i know as it leaves my hands it will miss and then clove slams into me knocking me flat on my back pinning my shoulders to the ground with her knees this is it i think and hope for prims sake it will be fast but clove means to savor the moment even feels she has time no doubt cato is somewhere nearby guarding her waiting for thresh and possibly peeta wheres your boyfriend district twelve still hanging on she asks well as long as were talking im alive hes out there now hunting cato i snarl at her then i scream at the top of my lungs peeta clove jams her fist into my windpipe very effectively cutting off my voice but her heads whipping from side to side and i know for a moment shes at least considering im telling the truth since no peeta appears to save me she turns back to me liar she says with a grin hes nearly dead cato knows where he cut him youve probably got him strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his heart going whats in the pretty little backpack that medicine for lover boy too bad hell never get it clove opens her jacket its lined with an impressive array of knives she carefully selects an almost dainty looking number with a cruel curved blade i promised cato if he let me have you id give the audience a good show im struggling now in an effort to unseat her but its no use shes too heavy and her lock on me too tight forget it district twelve were going to kill you
