1 when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my fingers stretch out seeking
2 prims warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress she must have
3 had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother of course she did this is the day of the
4 reaping i prop myself up on one elbow theres
5 enough light in the bedroom to see them my little sister prim curled up on her side
6 cocooned in my mothers body their cheeks pressed together in sleep my mother looks
7 younger still worn but not so beaten down prims face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely
8 as the primrose for which she was named
9 my mother was very beautiful once too or so they tell me sitting at prims knees
