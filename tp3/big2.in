7 sharp zap and he jerks it back some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof always worried about our safety i say even though cinna has shown peeta the roof i wonder if were supposed to be up here now so late and alone ive never seen tributes on the training center roof before but that doesnt mean were not being taped do you think theyre watching us now maybe he admits come see the garden on the other side of the dome theyve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees from the branches hang hundreds of wind chimes which account for the tinkling i heard here in the garden on this windy night its enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard peeta looks at me expectantly i pretend to examine a blossom we were hunting in the woods one day hidden waiting for game i whisper you and your father he whispers back no my friend gale suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once except one as if it were giving a warning call and then we saw her im sure it was the same girl a boy was with her their
30 clothes were tattered they had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep they were running as if their lives depended on it i say for a moment im silent as i remember how the sight of this strange pair clearly not from district fleeing through the woods immobili zed us later we wondered if we could have helped them escape perhaps we might have concealed them if wed moved quickly gale and i were taken by surprise yes but were both hunters we know how animals look at bay we knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them but we only watched the hovercraft appeared out of nowhere i continue to peeta i mean one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there it didnt make a sound but they saw it a net dropped down on the girl and carried her up fast so fast like the elevator they shot some sort of spear through the boy it was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well but im certain he was dead we heard the girl scream once the boys name i think then it was gone the hovercraft vanished into thin air and the birds began to sing again as if nothing had happened did they see you peeta asked i dont know we were under a shelf of rock i reply but i do know there was a moment after the birdcall but before the hovercraft where the girl had seen us shed locked eyes with me and called out for help but neither gale or i had responded youre shivering says peeta the wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body the girls scream had it been her last peeta
22 takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders i start to take a step back but then i let him deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness a friend would do that right they were from here he asks and he secures a button at my neck i nod theyd had that capitol look about them the boy and the girl where do you suppose they were going he asks i dont know that i say district is pretty much the end of the line beyond us theres only wilderness if you dont count the ruins of district that still smolder from the toxic bombs they show it on television occasionally just to remind us or why they would leave here haymitch had called the avoxes traitors against
11 what it could only be the capitol but they had everything here no cause to rebel id leave here peeta blurts out then he looks around nervously it was loud enough to hear above the chimes he laughs id go home now if they let me but you have to admit the foods prime hes covered again if thats all youd heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the capitol its getting chilly we better go in he says inside the dome its warm and bright his tone is conversational your friend gale hes the one who took your sister away at the reaping yes do you know him i ask not really i hear the girls talk about him a lot i thought he was your cousin or something you favor each other he says no were not related i say peeta nods unreadable did he come to say good bye to you yes i say observing him carefully so did your father he brought me cookies peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news but after watching him lie so smoothly i dont give this much weight really well he likes you and your sister i think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys the idea that i might ever have been discussed around the dinner table at the bakery fire just in passing in peetas house gives me a start it must have been when the mother was out of the room he knew your mother when they were kids says peeta another surprise but probably true oh yes she grew up in town i say it seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread were at my door i give back his
23 jacket see you in the morning then see you he says and walks off down the hall when i open my door the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where i left them on the floor before my shower i want to apologi ze for possibly getting her in trouble earlier but i remember im not supposed to speak to her unless im giving her an order oh sorry i say i was supposed to get those back to cinna im sorry can you take them to him she avoids my eyes gives a small nod and heads out the door id set out to tell her i was sorry about dinner but i know that my apology runs much deeper that im ashamed i never tried to help her in the woods that i let the capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a finger just like i was watching the games i kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes the shivering hasnt stopped perhaps the girl doesnt even remember me but i know she does you dont forget the face of the person who was your last hope i pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak but i can feel her eyes staring at me piercing through walls and doors and bedding i wonder if shell enjoy watching me die my slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams the face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier hunger games with my mother withdrawn and unreachable with prim emaciated and terrified i bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of light dawn is breaking through the windows the capitol has a misty haunted air my
7 head aches and i must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night my tongue probes the ragged flesh and i taste blood slowly i drag myself out of bed and into the shower i arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me then im deluged in lemony foam that i have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush oh well at least my blood is flowing when im dried and moisturi zed with lotion i find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet tight black pants a long sleeved burgundy tunic and leather shoes i put my hair in the single braid down my back this is the first time since the morning of the reaping that i resemble myself no fancy hair and clothes no flaming capes just me looking like i could be headed for the woods it calms me haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for break last and no one has contacted me this morning but im hungry so i head down to the dining room hoping there will be food im not disappointed while the table is empty a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes a young man an avox stands at attention by the spread when i ask if i can serve myself he nods assent i load a plate with eggs sausages batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves slices of pale purple melon as i gorge myself i watch the sun rise over the capitol i have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew finally i fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate the way peeta did on the train my mind wanders to my mother and prim they must be up my mother getting their breakfast of mush prim milking her goat before school just two mornings ago i was home can that be right yes just two and now how empty the house feels even from a distance what did they say last night about my fiery debut at the games did it give them hope or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty four tributes circled together knowing only one could live haymitch and peeta come in bid me good morning fill their plates it makes me irritated that peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit i am i need to say something to cinna this twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the games begin surely they must know this then i remember haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do if it was anyone but cinna i might be tempted to ignore him but after last nights triumph i dont have a lot of room to critici ze his choices im nervous about the training there will be three days in which all the tributes practice together on the last afternoon well each get a chance to perform in private before the gamemakers the thought of meeting the other tributes face to face makes me queasy i turn the roll i have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands but my appetite is gone when haymitch has finished several platters of stew he pushes back his plate with a sigh he takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table so lets get down to business training first off if you like ill coach you separately decide now why would you coach us separately
11 i ask say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about says haymitch i exchange a look with peeta i dont have any secret skills he says and i already know what yours is right i mean ive eaten enough of your squirrels i never thought about peeta eating the squirrels i shot somehow i always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself not out of greed but because town families usually eat expensive butcher
30 meat beef and chicken and horse you can coach us together i tell haymitch peeta nods all right so give me some idea of what you can do says haymitch i cant do anything says peeta unless you count baking bread sorry i dont katniss i already know youre handy with a knife says haymitch not really but i can hunt i say with a bow and arrow and youre good asks haymitch i have to think about it ive been putting food on the table for four years thats no small task im not as good as my father was but hed had more practice ive better aim than gale but ive had more practice hes a genius with traps and snares im all right i say shes excellent says peeta my father buys her squirrels he always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body she hits every one in the eye its the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher she can even bring down deer this assessment of my skills from peeta takes me totally by surprise first that he ever noticed second that hes talking me up what are you doing i ask him suspiciously what are you doing if hes going to help you he has to know what youre capable of dont underrate yourself says peeta i dont know why but this rubs me the wrong way what about you ive seen you in the market you can lift hundred pound bags of flour 
8 snap at him tell him that thats not nothing yes and im sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people its not like being able to use a weapon you know it isnt he shoots back he can wrestle i tell haymitch he came in second in our school competition last year only after his brother what use is that how many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death says peeta in disgust theres always hand to hand combat all you need is to come up with a knife and youll at least stand a chance if i get jumped im dead i can hear my voice rising in anger but you wont youll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows you know what my mother said to me when she came to say good bye as if to cheer me up she says maybe district twelve will finally have a winner then i reali zed she didnt mean me she meant you bursts out peeta oh she meant you i say with a wave of dismissal she said shes a survivor that one she is says peeta that pulls me up short did his mother really say that about me did she rate me over her son i see the pain in peetas eyes and know he isnt lying suddenly im behind the bakery and i can feel the chill of the rain running down my back the hollowness in my belly i sound eleven years old when i speak but only because someone helped me peetas eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands and i know he remembers that day too but he just shrugs people will help you in the arena theyll be tripping over each other to sponsor you no more than you i say peeta rolls his eyes at haymitch she has no idea the effect she can have he runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table refusing to look at me what on earth does he mean people help me when we were dying of starvation no one helped me no one except peeta once i had something to barter with things changed im a tough trader or am i what effect do i have that im weak and needy is he suggesting that i got good deals because people pitied me i try to think if this is true perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades but i always attributed that to their long standing relationship with my father besides my game is first class no one pitied me i glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me after about a minute of this haymitch says well then well well well katniss theres no guarantee theyll be bows and arrows in the arena but during your private session with the gamemakers show them what you can do until then stay clear of archery are you any good at trapping i know a few basic snares i mutter that may be significant in terms of
11 food says haymitch and peeta shes right never underestimate strength in the arena very often physical power tilts the advantage to a player in the training center they will have weights but dont reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes the plans the same for both of you you go to group training spend the time trying to learn something you dont know throw a spear swing a mace learn to tie a decent knot save showing what youre best at until your private sessions are we clear says haymitch peeta and i nod one last thing in public i want you by each others side every minute says haymitch we both start to object but haymitch slams his hand on the table every minute its not open for discussion you agreed to do as i said you will be together you will appear amiable to each other now get out meet effie at the elevator at ten for training i bite my lip and stalk back to my room making sure peeta can hear the door slam i sit on the bed hating haymitch hating peeta hating myself for mentioning that day long ago in the rain its such a joke peeta and i going along pretending to be friends talking up each others strengths insisting the other take credit for their abilities because in fact at some point were going to have to knock it off and accept were bitter adversaries which id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together in training its my own fault i guess for telling him he didnt have to coach us separately but that didnt mean i wanted to do everything with peeta who by the way clearly doesnt want to be partnering up with me either i hear peetas voice in my head she has no idea the effect she can have obviously meant to demean me right but a tiny part of me wonders if this
19 was a compliment that he meant i was appealing in some way its weird how much hes noticed me like the attention hes paid to my hunting and apparently i have not been as oblivious to him as i imagined either the flour the wrestling i have kept track of the boy with the bread its almost ten i clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again anger temporarily
24 blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes but now i can feel my anxiety rising again by the time i meet effie and peeta at the elevator i catch myself biting my nails i stop at once the actual training rooms are below ground level of our building with these elevators the ride is less than a minute the doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses although its not yet ten were the last ones to arrive the other tributes are gathered in a tense circle they each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts while someone pins the number on my back i do a quick assessment peeta and i are the only two dressed alike as soon as we join the circle the head trainer a tall athletic woman named atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule experts in each skill will remain at their stations we will be free to travel from area to area as we choose per our mentors instructions some of the stations teach survival skills others fighting techniques we are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute there are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner when atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations my eyes cant help flitting around to the other tributes its the first time weve been assembled on level ground in simple clothes my heart sinks almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than i am even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly you can see it in their bones their skin the hollow look in their eyes i may be smaller naturally but
15 overall my familys resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area i stand straight and while im thin im strong the meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those i see around me the exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts the volunteers the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment the tributes from and traditionally have this look about them its technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the capitol but it happens every year in district we call them the career tributes or just the careers and like as not the winner will be one of them the slight advantage i held coming into the training center my fiery entrance last night seems to vanish in the presence of my competition the other tributes were jealous of us but not because we were ama zing because our stylists were now i see nothing but contempt in the glances of the career tributes each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me they project arrogance and brutality when atala releases us they head straight for the deadliest looking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease im thinking that its lucky im a fast runner when peeta nudges my arm and i jump he is still beside me per haymitchs instructionshis expression is sober where would you like to start i look around at the career tributes who are showing off clearly trying to intimidate the field then at the others the underfed the incompetent shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax suppose we tie some knots i say right you are says peeta we cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students you get the feeling that the knot tying class is not the hunger games hot spot when he reali zes i know something about snares he shows us a simple excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree we concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it then we move on to camouflage peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin weaving disguises from vines and leaves the trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work i do the cakes he admits to me the cakes i ask ive been preoccupied with watching the boy from district send a spear through a dummys heart from fifteen yards what cakes at home the iced ones for the bakery he says he means the ones they display in the windows fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting theyre for birthdays and new years day when were in the square prim always drags me over to admire them although wed never be able to afford one theres little enough beauty in district though so i can hardly deny her this i look more critically at the design on peetas arm the alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods i wonder how he knows this since i doubt hes ever been beyond the fence
7 has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard somehow the whole thing his skill those inaccessible cakes the praise of the camouflage expert annoys me its lovely if only you could frost someone to death i say dont be so superior you can never tell what youll find in the arena say its actually a gigantic cake begins peeta say we move on i break in so the next three days pass with peeta and i going quietly from station to station we do pick up some valuable skills from starting fires to knife throwing to making shelter despite haymitchs order to appear mediocre peeta excels in hand to hand combat and i sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye we steer clear of archery and weightlifting though wanting to save those for our private sessions the gamemakers appeared early on the first day twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes they sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium sometimes wandering about to watch us jotting down notes other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them ignoring the lot of us but they do seem to be keeping their eye on the district tributes several times ive looked up to find one fixated
18 on me they consult with the trainers during our meals as well we see them all gathered together when we come back breakfast and dinner are served on our floor but at lunch the twenty four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself the career tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table as if to prove their superiority that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice most of the other tributes sit alone like lost sheep no one says a word to us peeta and i eat together and since haymitch keeps dogging us about it try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals its not easy to find a topic talking of home is painful talking of the present unbearable one day peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful to include types from the districts along with the refined bread of the capitol the fish shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed
22 from district the crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from district somehow although its made from the same stuff it looks a lot more appeti zing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home and there you have it says peeta scooping the breads back in the basket you certainly know a lot i say only about
25 bread he says okay now laugh as if ive said something funny we both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room all right ill keep smiling pleasantly and you talk says peeta its wearing us both out haymitchs direction to be friendly because ever since i slammed my door theres been a chill in the air between us but we have our orders did i ever tell you about the time i was chased by a bear 
3 ask no but it sounds fascinating says peeta i try and animate my face as i recall the event a true story in which id foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue hes much better at this than i am on the second day while were taking a shot at spear throwing he whispers to me i think we have a shadow i throw my spear which im not too bad at actually if i dont have to throw too far and see the little girl from district standing back a bit watching us shes the twelve year old the one who reminded me so of prim in stature up close she looks about ten she has bright dark eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound its impossible not to think of a bird i pick up another spear while peeta throws i think her names rue he says softly i bite my lip rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the meadow rue primrose neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet what can we do about it i ask him more harshly than i intended nothing to do he says back just making conversation now that i know shes there its hard to ignore the child she slips up and joins us at different stations like me shes clever with plants climbs swiftly and has good aim she can hit the target every time with a slingshot but what is a slingshot against a pound male with a sword back on the district floor haymitch and effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day what we did who watched us how the other tributes si ze up cinna and
3 portia arent around so theres no one to add any sanity to the meals not that haymitch and effie are fighting anymore instead they seem to be of one mind determined to whip us into shape full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training peeta is more patient but i become fed up and surly when we finally escape to bed on the second night peeta mumbles someone ought to get haymitch a drink i make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh then catch myself its messing with my mind too much trying to keep straight when were supposedly friends and when were not at least when we get into the arena ill know where we stand dont dont lets pretend when theres no one around all right katniss he says tiredly after that we only talk in front of people on the third day of training they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the gamemakers district by district first the boy then the girl tribute as usual district is slated to go last we linger in the dining room unsure where else to go no one comes back once they have left as the room empties the pressure to appear friendly lightens by the time they call rue we are left alone we sit in silence until they summon peeta he rises remember what haymitch said about being sure to throw the weights the words come out of my mouth without permission thanks i will he says you shoot straight i nod i dont know why i said anything at all although if im going to lose id rather peeta win than the others better for our district for my mother and prim after about fifteen minutes they call my name i smooth my hair set my shoulders back and walk into the gymnasium instantly i know im in trouble theyve been here too long the gamemakers sat through twenty three other demonstrations had too much to wine most of them want more than anything to go home theres nothing i can do but continue with the plan i walk to the archery station oh the weapons ive been itching to get my hands on them for days bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials i cant even name arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines i choose a bow string it and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder theres a shooting range but its much too limited standard bulls eyes and human silhouettes i walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target the dummy used for knife practice even as i pull back on the bow i know something is wrong the strings tighter than the one i use at home the arrows more rigid i miss the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention i had been commanding for a moment im humiliated then i head back to the bulls eye i shoot again and again until i get the feel of these new weapons back in the center of the gymnasium i take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart then i sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground without pausing i shoulder roll forward come up on one knee and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor a shower of sparks bursts from the fixture its excellent shooting i turn to the gamemakers a few are nodding approval but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table suddenly i am furious that with my life on the line they dont even have the decency to pay attention to me that im being upstaged by a dead pig my heart starts to pound i can feel my face burning without thinking i pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the gamemakers table i hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back the arrow skewers the apple in the pigs mouth and pins it to the wall behind it everyone stares at me in disbelief thank you for your consideration i say then i give a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being dismissed as i stride toward the elevator i fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other i brush past the gaping avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist the doors slide together and i zip upward i actually make it back to my
17 floor before the tears start running down my cheeks i can hear the others calling me from the sitting room but i fly down the hall into my room bolt the door and fling myself onto my bed then i really begin to sob now ive done it now ive ruined everything if id stood even a ghost of chance it vanished when i sent that arrow flying at the gamemakers what will they do to me now arrest me execute me cut my tongue and turn me into an avox so i can wait on the future tributes of panem what was i thinking shooting at the gamemakers of course i wasnt i was shooting at that apple because i was so angry at being ignored i wasnt trying to kill one of them if i were theyd be dead oh what
28 does it matter its not like i was going to win the games anyway who cares what they do to me what really scares me is what they might do to my mother and prim how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness will they take their few belongings or send my mother to prison and prim to the community home or kill them they wouldnt kill them would they why not what do they care i should have stayed and apologi zed or laughed like it was a big joke then maybe i would have found some leniency but instead i stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible haymitch and effie are knocking on my door i shout for them to go away and eventually they do it takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out then i just lay curled up on the bed stroking the silken sheets watching the sun set over the artificial candy capitol at first i expect guards to come for me but as time passes it seems less likely i calm down they still need a girl tribute from district dont they if the gamemakers want to punish me they can do it publicly wait until im in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me you can bet theyll make sure i dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself before that though theyll give me a score so low no one in their right mind would sponsor me thats what will happen tonight since the training isnt open to viewers the gamemakers announce a score for each player it gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the games the number which is between one and twelve one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high signifies the promise of the tribute the mark is not a guarantee of which person will win its only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training often because of the variables in the actual arena high scoring tributes go down almost immediately and a few years ago the boy who won the games only received a three still the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship i had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven even if im not particularly powerful now im sure ill have the lowest score of the twenty four if no one sponsors me my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero when effie taps on the door to call me to dinner i decide i may as well go the scores will be televised tonight its not like i can hide what happened forever i go to the bathroom and wash my face but its still red and splotchy everyones waiting at the table even cinna and portia i wish the stylists hadnt shown up because for some reason i dont like the idea of disappointing them its as if ive thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought i avoid looking at anyone as i take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup the saltiness reminds me of my tears the adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast and i let my eyes meet peetas he raises his eyebrows a question what happened i just give my head a small shake then as theyre serving the main course i hear haymitch say okay enough small talk just how bad were you today peeta jumps in i dont know that it mattered by the time i showed up no one even bothered to look at me they were singing some kind of drinking song i think so i threw around some heavy objects until they told me i could go that makes me feel a bit better its not like peeta attacked the gamemakers
15 but at least he was provoked too and you sweetheart says haymitch somehow haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that im at least able to speak i shot an arrow at the gamemakers everyone stops eating you what the horror in effies voice confirms my worse suspicions i shot an arrow at them not exactly at them in their direction its like peeta said i was shooting and they were ignoring me and i just i just lost my head so i shot an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth i say defiantly and what did they say says cinna carefully nothing or i dont know i walked out after that i say without being dismissed gasps effie i dismissed myself i said i remember how i promised prim that i really would try to win and i feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me well thats that says haymitch then he butters a roll do you think theyll arrest me i ask doubt it be a pain to replace you at this stage says haymitch what about my family i say will they punish them dont think so wouldnt make much sense see theyd have to reveal what happened in the training center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population people would need to know what you did but they cant since its
3 secret so itd be a waste of effort says haymitch more likely theyll make your life hell in the arena well theyve already promised to do that to us any way says peeta very true says haymitch and i reali ze the impossible has happened they have actually cheered me up haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers which makes effie frown and dunks it in his wine he rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckle what were their faces like i can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up shocked terrified uh ridiculous some of them an image pops into my mind one man tripped backward into a bowl of punch haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except effie although even she is suppressing a smile well it serves them right its their job to pay attention to you and just because you come from district twelve is no excuse to ignore you then her eyes dart around as if shes said something totally outrageous im sorry but thats what i think she says to no one in particular ill get a very bad score i say scores only matter if theyre very good no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones for all they know you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose people use that strategy said portia i hope thats how people interpret the four ill probably get says peeta if that really is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards one almost landed on my foot i grin at him and reali ze that im starving i cut off a piece of pork dunk it in mashed potatoes and start eating its okay my family is safe and if they are safe no real harm has been done after dinner we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television first they show a photo of the tribute then flash their score below it the career tributes naturally get in the eight to ten range most of the other players average a five surprisingly little rue comes up with a seven i dont know what she showed the judges but shes so tiny it must have been impressive district comes up last as usual peeta pulls an eight so at least a couple of the gamemakers must have been watching him i dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up expecting the worst then theyre flashing the number eleven on the screen eleven effie trinket lets out a squeal and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me but it doesnt seem real there must be a mistake how how could that happen i ask haymitch guess they liked your temper he says theyve got a show to put on they need some players with some heat katniss the girl who was on fire says cinna and gives me a hug oh wait until you see your interview dress more flames i ask of a sort he says mischievously peeta and i congratulate each other another awkward moment weve both done well but what does that mean for the other i escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers the stress of the day particularly the crying has worn me out i drift off reprieved relieved and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids at dawn i lie in bed for a while watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning its sunday a day off at home i wonder if gale is in the woods yet usually we devote all of sunday to stocking up for the week rising early hunting and gathering then trading at the hob i think of gale without me both of us can hunt alone but were better as a pair particularly if were trying for bigger game but also in the littler things having a partner lightened the load could even make the arduous task of filling my familys table enjoyable i had been struggling along on my own for about six months when i first ran into gale in the woods it was a sunday in october the air cool and pungent with dying things id spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting katniss the only meat id shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my
21 other food sources having strayed farther afield than usual i was hurrying back home lugging my burlap sacks when i came across a dead rabbit it was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head about fifteen yards away was another i recogni zed the twitch up snares because my father had used them when the prey is caught its yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals id been trying to use snares all summer with no success so i couldnt help dropping my sacks to examine this one my fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out thats dangerous i jumped back several feet as gale materiali zed from behind a tree he must have been watching me the whole time he was only fourteen but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me id seen him around the seam and at school and one other time hed lost his father in the same blast that killed mine in january id stood by while he received his medal of valor in the justice building another oldest child with no father i remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from
27 giving birth whats your name he said coming over and disengaging the rabbit from the snare he had another three hanging from his belt katniss i said barely audible well catnip stealings punishable by death or hadnt you heard he said katniss i said louder and i wasnt stealing it i just wanted to look at your snare mine never catch anything he scowled at me not convinced so whered you get the squirrel i shot it i pulled my bow off my shoulder i was still using the small version my father had made me but id been practicing with the full si ze one when i could i was hoping that by spring i might be able to bring down some bigger game gales eyes fastened on the bow can i see that i handed it over just remember stealings punishable by death that was the first time i ever saw him smile it transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew but it took several months before i returned that smile we talked hunting then i told him i might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade not food i wanted knowledge i wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day he agreed something might be worked out as the seasons went by we grudgingly began to share our knowledge our weapons our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys he taught me snares and fishing i showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows and then one day without either of us saying it we became a team dividing the work and the spoils making sure that both our families had food gale gave me a sense of security id lacked since my fathers death his companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods i became a much better hunter when i didnt have to look over my shoulder constantly when someone was watching my back but he turned into so much more than a hunting partner he became my confidante someone with whom i could share thoughts i could never voice inside
16 the fence in exchange he trusted me with his being out in the woods with gale sometimes i was actually happy i call him my friend but in the last year its seemed too casual a word for what gale is to me a pang of longing shoots through my chest if only he was with me now but of course i dont want that i dont want him in the arena where hed be dead in a few days i just i just miss him and i hate being so alone does he miss me he must i think of the eleven flashing under my name last night i know exactly what hed say to me well theres some room for improvement there and then hed give me a smile and id return it without hesitating now i cant help comparing what i have with gale to what im pretending to have with peeta how i never question gales motives while i do nothing but doubt the latters its not a fair comparison really gale and i were thrown together by a mutual need to survive peeta and i know the others survival means our own death how do you sidestep that effies knocking at the door reminding me theres another big big big day ahead tomorrow night will be our televised interviews i guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that i get up and take a quick shower being a bit more careful about the buttons i hit and head down to the
5 dining room peeta effie and haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices that seems odd but hunger wins out over curiosity and i load up my plate with breakfast before i join them the stews made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today perfect on the bed of wild rice ive shoveled about halfway through the mound when i reali ze no ones talking i take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth so whats going on youre coaching us on interviews today right thats right says haymitch you dont have to wait until im done i can listen and cat at the same time i say well theres been a change of plans about our current approach says haymitch whats that i ask im not sure what our current approach is trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy i remember haymitch shrugs peeta has asked to be coached separately betrayal thats the first thing i feel which is ludicrous for there to be betrayal there would have had to been trust first between peeta and me and trust has not been part of the agreement were tributes but the boy who risked a beating to give me bread the one who steadied me in the chariot who covered for me with the redheaded avox girl who insisted haymitch know my hunting skills was there some part of me that couldnt help trusting him on the other hand im relieved that we can stop the pretense of being friends obviously whatever thin connection wed foolishly formed has been severed and high time too the games begin in two days and trust will only be a weakness whatever triggered peetas decision and i suspect it had to do with my outperforming him in training i should be nothing but grateful for it maybe hes finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies the better good i say so whats the schedule youll each have four hours with effie for presentation and four with me for content says haymitch you start with effie katniss i cant imagine what effie will have to teach me that could take four hours but shes got me working down to the last minute we go to my rooms and she puts me in a full length gown and high heeled shoes not the ones ill he wearing for the actual interview and instructs
2 me on walking the shoes are the worst part ive never worn high heels and cant get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet but effie runs around in them full time and im determined that if she can do it so can i the dress poses anotherproblem it keeps tangling around my shoes so of course i hitch it up and then effie swoops down on me like a hawk smacking my hands and yelling not above the ankle when i finally conquer walking theres still sitting posture apparently i have a tendency to duck my head eye contact hand gestures and smiling smiling is mostly about smiling more effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile while smiling or ending with a smile by lunch the muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse well thats the best i can do effie says with a sigh just remember katniss you want the audience to like you and you dont think they will i ask not if you glare at them the entire time why dont you save that for the arena instead think of yourself among friends says effie theyre betting on how long ill live i burst out theyre not my friends well try and pretend snaps effie then she composes herself and beams at me see like this im smiling at you even though youre aggravating me yes it feels very convincing i say im going to eat kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room hiking my skirt up to my thighs peeta and haymitch seem in pretty good moods so im thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning i couldnt be more wrong after lunch haymitch takes me into the sitting room directs me to the couch and then just frowns at me for a while what i finally ask
