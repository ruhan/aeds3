23 im trying to figure out what to do with you he says how were going to present you are you going to be charming aloof fierce so far youre shining like a star you volunteered to save your sister cinna made you look unforgettable youve got the top training score people are intrigued but no one knows who you are the impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what i can get you in terms of sponsors says haymitch having watched the tribute interviews all my life i know theres truth to what hes saying if you appeal to the crowd either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric you gain favor whats peetas approach or am i not allowed to ask i say likable he has a sort of self deprecating humor naturally says haymitch whereas when you open your mouth you come across more as sullen and hostile i do not i say please i dont know where you pulled that cheery wavy girl on the chariot from but i havent seen her before or since says haymitch and youve given me so many reasons to be cheery i counterbut you dont have to please me im not going to sponsor you so pretend im the audience says haymitch delight me fine i snarl haymitch takes the role of the interviewer and i try to answer his questions in a winning fashion but i cant im too angry with haymitch for what he said and that i even have to answer the questions all i can think is how unjust the whole thing is the hunger games why am i hopping around like some trained dog trying to please people i hate the longer the interview goes on the more my fury seems to rise to the surface until im literally spitting out answers at him all right enough he says weve got to find another angle not only are you hostile i dont know anything about you ive asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life your family what you care about they want to know about you katniss but i dont want them to theyre already taking my future they cant have the things that mattered to me in the past i say then lie make something up says haymitch im not good at lying i say well you better learn fast youve got about as much charm as a dead slug says haymitch ouch that hurts even haymitch must know hes been too harsh because his voice softens heres an idea try acting humble humble i echo that you cant believe a little girl from district twelve has done this well the whole things been more than you ever could have dreamed of talk about cinnas clothes how nice the people are how the city ama zes you if you wont talk about yourself at least compliment the audience just keep turning it back around all right gush the next hours are agoni zing at once its clear i cannot gush we try me playing cocky but i just dont have the arrogance apparently im too vulnerable for ferocity im not witty funny sexy or mysterious by the end of the session i am no one at all haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty and a nasty edge has crept into his voice i give up sweetheart just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you despise them i have dinner that night in my room ordering an outrageous number of delicacies eating myself sick and then taking out my anger at haymitch at the hunger games at every living being in the capitol by smashing dishes around my room when the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down my bed her eyes widen at the mess just leave it i yell at her just leave it alone i hate her too with her knowing reproachful eyes that call me a coward a monster a puppet of the capitol both now and then for her justice must finally be happening at least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods but instead of fleeing the room the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom she comes back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands why is she doing this why am i letting her i should have tried to save you i whisper she shakes her head does this mean we were right to stand by
12 that she has forgiven me no it was wrong i say she taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest i think she means that i would just have ended up an avox too probably would have an avox or dead i spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the room when all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away she turns down my bed i crawl in between the sheets like a five year old and let her tuck me in then she goes i want her to stay until i fall asleep to be there when i wake up i want the protection of this girl even though she never had mine in the morning its not the girl but my prep team who are hanging over me my lessons with effie and haymitch are over this day belongs to cinna hes my last hope maybe he can make me look so wonderful no one will care what comes out of my mouth the team works on me until late afternoon turning my skin to glowing satin stenciling patterns on my arms painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails then venia goes to work on my hair weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear wraps around my head and then falls in one braid down my right shoulder they erase my face with a layer of pale
20 makeup and draw my features back out huge dark eyes full red lips lashes that throw off bits of light when i blink finally they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust then cinna enters with what i assume is my dress but i cant really see it because its covered close your eyes he orders i can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my naked body then the weight it must be forty pounds i clutch octavias hand as i blindly step into my shoes glad to find they are at least two inches lower than the pair effie had me practice in theres some adjusting and fidgeting then silence can i open my eyes i ask yes says cinna open them the creature standing before me in the full length mirror has come from another world where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels because my dress oh my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design the slightest movement gives the impression i am engulfed in tongues of fire i am not pretty i am not beautiful i am as radiant as the sun for a while we all just stare at me oh cinna i finally whisper thank you twirl for me he says i hold out my arms and spin in a circle the prep team screams in admiration cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes which are infinitely more manageable than effies the dress hangs in such a way that i dont have to lift the skirt when i walk leaving me with one less thing to worry about so all ready for the interview then asks cinna i can see by his expression that hes been talking to haymitch that he knows how dreadful i am im awful haymitch called me a dead slug no matter what we tried i couldnt do it i just cant be one of those people he wants me to be i say cinna thinks about this a moment why dont you just be yourself myself thats no good either haymitch says im sullen and hostile i say well you are around haymitch says cinna with a grin i dont find you so the prep team adores you you even won over the gamemakers and as for the citi zens of the capitol well they cant stop talking about you no one can help but admire your spirit my spirit this is a new thought im not sure exactly what it means but it suggests im a fighter in a sort of brave way its not as if im never friendly okay maybe i dont go around loving everybody i meet maybe my smiles are hard to come by but i do care for some people cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones suppose when you answer the questions you think youre addressing a friend back home who would your best friend be asks cinna gale i say instantly only it doesnt make sense cinna i would never be telling gale those things about me he already knows them what about me could you think of me as a friend asks cinna of all the people ive met since i left home cinna is by far my favorite i liked him right off and he hasnt
9 disappointed me yet i think so but ill be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists youll be able to look right at me when youre asked a question find me and answer it as honestly as possible says cinna even if what i think is horrible i ask because it might be really especially if what you think is horrible says cinna youll try it i nod its a plan or at least a straw to grasp at too soon its time to go the interviews take place on a stage constructed in front of the training center once i leave my room it will be only minutes until im in front of the crowd the cameras all of panem as cinna turns the doorknob i stop his hand cinna im completely overcome with stage fright remember they already love you he says gently just be yourself we meet up with the rest of the district crowd at the elevator portia and her gang have been hard at work peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame accents while we look well together its a relief not to be dressed identically haymitch and effie are all fancied up for the occasion i avoid haymitch but accept effies compliments effie can be tiresome and clueless but shes not destructive like haymitch when the elevator opens the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage all twenty four of us sit in a big arc throughout the interviews ill be last or second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy from each district how i wish i could be first and get the whole thing out of the way now ill have to listen to how witty funny humble fierce and charming everybody else is before i go up plus the audience will start to get bored just as the gamemakers did and i cant exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention right before we parade onto the stage haymitch comes up behind peeta and me and growls remember youre still a happy pair so act like it what i thought we abandoned that when peeta asked for separate coaching but i guess that was a private not a public thing anyway theres not much chance for interaction now as we walk single file to our seats and take our places just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow i can feel my pulse pounding in my temples its a relief to get to my chair because between the heels and my legs shaking im afraid ill trip although evening is falling the city circle is brighter than a summers day an elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests with the stylists commanding the front row the cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork a large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the gamemakers television crews have claimed most of the other balconies but the city circle and the avenues that feed into it are completely packed with people standing room only at homes and community halls around the country every television set is turned on every citi zen of panem is tuned in there will be no blackouts tonight caesar flickerman the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty years bounces onto the stage its a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time same face under a coating of pure white makeup same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each hunger games same ceremonial suit midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars they do surgery in the capitol to make people appear younger and thinner in district looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early you see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity
23 ask the secret of survival a plump person is envied because they arent scraping by like the majority of us but here it is different wrinkles arent desirable a round belly isnt a sign of success this year caesars hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue he looks freakish but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson and he seemed to be bleeding caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience but then gets down to business the girl tribute from district looking provocative in a see through gold gown steps up the center of the stage to join caesar for her interview you can tell her mentor didnt have any trouble coming up with an angle for her with that flowing blonde hair emerald green eyes her body tall and lush shes sexy all the way each interview only lasts three minutes then a bu z zer goes off and the next tribute is up ill say this for caesar he really does his best to make the tributes shine hes friendly tries to set the nervous ones at ease laughs at lame jokes and can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts i sit like a lady the way effie showed me as the districts slip by everyone seems to be playing up some angle the monstrous boy from district is a ruthless killing machine the fox faced girl from district sly and elusive i spotted cinna as soon as he took his place but even his presence cannot relax me the crippled boy from is very quiet my palms are sweating like cra zy but the jeweled dress isnt absorbent and they skid right of if i try to dry them rue who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings flutters her way to caesar a hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute caesars very sweet with her complimenting her seven in training an excellent score for one so small when he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be she doesnt hesitate im very hard to catch she says in a tremulous voice and if they cant catch me they cant kill me so dont count me out i wouldnt in a million years says caesar encouragingly the boy tribute from district thresh has the same dark skin as rue but the resemblance stops there hes one of the giants probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox but i noticed he rejected the invitations from the career tributes to join their crowd instead hes been very solitary speaking to no one showing little interest in training even so he scored a ten and its not hard to imagine he impressed the gamemakers he ignores caesars attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or just remains silent if only i was his si ze i could get away with sullen and hostile and it would be just fine i bet half the sponsors are at least considering him if i had any money id bet on him myself and then theyre calling katniss everdeen and i feel myself as if in a dream standing and making my way center stage i shake caesars outstretched hand and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit so katniss the capitol must be quite a change from district twelve whats impressed you most since you arrived here asks caesar what what did he say its as if the words make no sense my mouth has gone as dry as sawdust i desperately find cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him i imagine the words coming from his lips whats impressed you most since you arrived here i rack my brain for something that made me happy here be honest i think be honest the lamb stew i get out caesar laughs and vaguely i reali ze some of the audience has joined in the one with the dried plums asks caesar i nod oh i eat it by the bucketful he turns sideways to the audience in horror hand on his stomach it doesnt show does it they shout reassurances to him and applaud this is what i mean about
26 caesar he tries to help you out now katniss he says confidentially when you came out in the opening ceremonies my heart actually stopped what did you think of that costume cinna raises one eyebrow at me be honest you mean after i got over my fear of being burned alive i ask big laugh a real one from the audience yes
11 start then says caesar cinna my friend i should tell him anyway i thought cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume id ever seen and i couldnt believe i was wearing it i cant believe im wearing this either i lift up my skirt to spread it out i mean look at it as the audience oohs and ahs i see cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger but i know what hes saying twirl for me i spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate oh do that again says caesar and so i lift up my arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out letting the dress engulf me in flames the audience breaks into cheers when i stop i clutch caesars arm dont stop he says i have to im di z zy im also giggling which i think ive done maybe never in my lifetime but the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me caesar wraps a protective arm around me dont worry ive got you cant have you following in your mentors footsteps everyones hooting as the cameras find haymitch who is by now famous for his head dive at
17 the reaping and he waves them away good naturedly and points back to me its all right caesar reassures the crowd shes safe with me so how about that training score e le ven give us a hint what happened in there i glance at the gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip um all i can say is i think it was a first the cameras are right on the gamemakers who are chuckling and nodding youre killing us says caesar as if in actual pain details details i address the balcony im not supposed to talk about it right the gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out shes not thank you i say sorry my lips are sealed lets go back then to the moment they called your sisters name at the reaping says caesar his mood is quieter now and you volunteered can you tell us about her no no not all of you but maybe cinna i dont think im imagining the sadness on his face her
9 names prim shes just twelve and i love her more than anything you could hear a pin drop in the city circle now what did she say to you after the reaping caesar asks be honest be honest i swallow hard she asked me to try really hard to win the audience is fro zen hanging on my every word and what did you say prompts caesar gently but instead of warmth i feel an icy rigidity take over my body my muscles tense as they do before a kill when i speak my voice seems to have dropped an octave i swore i would i bet you did says caesar giving me a squee ze the bu z zer goes off sorry were out of time best of luck katniss everdeen tribute from district twelve the applause continues long after im seated i look to cinna for reassurance he gives me a subtle thumbs up im still in a da ze for the first part of peetas interview he has the audience from the get go though i can hear them laughing shouting out he plays up the bakers son thing comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts then has a funny anecdote about the perils of the capitol showers tell me do i still smell like roses he asks caesar and then theres a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house im coming back into focus when caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home peeta hesitates then gives an unconvincing shake of his head handsome lad like you there must be some special girl come on whats her name says caesar peeta sighs well there is this one girl ive had a crush on her ever since i can remember but im pretty sure she didnt know i was alive until the reaping sounds of sympathy from the crowd unrequited love they can relate to she have another fellow asks caesar i dont know but a lot of boys like her says peeta so heres what you do you win you go home she cant turn you down then eh says caesar encouragingly i dont think its going to work out winning wont help in my case says peeta why ever not says caesar mystified peeta blushes beet red and stammers out because because she came here with me part ii"the games"  for a moment the cameras hold on peetas downcast eyes as what he says sinks in then i can see my face mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest magnified on every screen as i reali ze me he means me i press my lips together and stare at the floor hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside of me oh that is a piece of bad luck says caesar and theres a real edge of pain in his voice the crowd is
26 murmuring in agreement a few have even given agoni zed cries its not good agrees peeta well i dont think any of us can blame you itd be hard not to fall for that young lady says caesar she didnt know peeta shakes his head not until now i allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable wouldnt you love to pull her back out here and get a response caesar asks the audience the crowd screams assent sadly rules are rules and katniss everdeens time has been spent well best of luck to you peeta mellark and i think i speak for all of panem when i say our hearts go with yours the roar of the crowd is deafening peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me when the audience finally settles down he chokes out a quiet thank you and returns to his seat we stand for the anthem i have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of peeta and me separated by a few feet that in the viewers heads can never be breached poor tragic us but i know better after the anthem the tributes file back into the training center lobby and onto the elevators i make sure to veer into a car that does not contain peeta the crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones so we have only each other for company no one speaks my elevator stops to deposit four tributes before i am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor peeta has only just stepped from his car when i slam my palms into his chest he loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers the urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces peeta lands in the shards and blood immediately flows from his hands what was that for he says aghast you had no right no right to go saying those things about me i shout at him now the elevators open and the whole crew is there effie haymitch cinna and portia whats going on says effie a note of hysteria in her voice did you fall after she shoved me says peeta as effie and cinna help him up haymitch turns on me shoved him this was your idea wasnt it turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country i answer it was my idea says peeta wincing as he pulls spikes of pottery from his palms haymitch just helped me with it yes haymitch is very helpful to you i say you are a fool haymitch says in disgust do you think he hurt you that boy just gave you something you could never achieve on your own he made me look weak i say he made you look desirable and
29 lets face it you can use all the help you can get in that department you were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted you now they all do youre all theyre talking about the star crossed lovers from district twelve says haymitch but were not star crossed lovers i say haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall who cares its all a big show its all how youre perceived the most i could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough although that in itself was a small miracle now i can say youre a heartbreaker oh oh oh how the boys back home fall longingly at your feet which do you think will get you more sponsors the smell of wine on his breath makes me sick i shove his hands off my shoulders and step away trying to clear my head cinna comes over and puts his arm around me hes right katniss i dont know what to think i should have been told so i didnt look so stupid no your reaction was perfect if youd known it wouldnt have read as real says portia shes just worried about her boyfriend says peeta gruffly tossing away a bloody piece of the urn my cheeks burn again at the thought of gale i dont have a boyfriend whatever says peeta but i bet hes smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it besides you didnt say you loved me so what does it matter the words are sinking in my anger fading im torn now between thinking ive been used and thinking ive been given an edge haymitch is right i survived my interview but what was i really a silly girl spinning in a sparkling dress giggling the only moment of any substance i hail was when i talked about prim compare that with thresh his silent deadly power and im forgettable silly and sparkly and forgettable no not entirely forgettable i have my eleven in training but now peeta has made me an object of love not just his to hear him tell it i have many admirers and if the audience really thinks were in love i remember how strongly they responded to his confession star crossed lovers haymitch is right they eat that stuff up in the capitol suddenly im worried that i didnt react properly after he said he loved me did you think i could be in love with him too i ask i did says portia the way you avoided looking at the cameras the blush they others chime in agreeing youre golden sweetheart youre going to have sponsors lined up around the block says haymitch im embarrassed about my reaction i force myself to acknowledge peeta im sorry i shoved you doesnt matter he shrugs although its technically illegal are your hands okay i ask theyll be all right he says in the silence that follows delicious smells of our dinner waft in from the dining room come on lets eat says haymitch we all follow him to the table and take our places but then peeta is bleeding too heavily and portia leads him off for medical treatment we start the cream and rose petal soup without them by the time weve finished theyre back peetas hands are wrapped in bandages i cant help feeling guilty
14 tomorrow we will be in the arena he has done me a favor and i have answered with an injury will i never stop owing him after dinner we watch the replay in the sitting room i seem frilly and shallow twirling and giggling in my dress although the others assure me i am charming peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love and there i am blushing and confused made beautiful by cinnas hands desirable by peetas confession tragic by circumstance and by all accounts unforgettable when the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark a hush falls on the room tomorrow at dawn we will be roused and prepared for the arena the actual games dont start until ten because so many of the capitol residents rise late but peeta and i must make an early start there is no telling how far we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this years games i know haymitch and effie will not be going with us as soon as they leave here theyll be at the games headquarters hopefully madly signing up our sponsors working out a strategy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us cinna and portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena still final good byes must be said here effie takes both of us by the hand and with actual tears in her eyes wishes us well thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor
19 and then because its effie and shes apparently required by law to say something awful she adds i wouldnt be at all surprised if i finally get promoted to a decent district next year then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over any final words of advice asks peeta when the gong sounds get the hell out of there youre neither of you up to the blood bath at the cornucopia just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water he says got it and after that i ask stay alive says haymitch its the same advice he gave us on the train but hes not drunk and laughing this time and we only nod what else is there to say when i head to my room peeta lingers to talk to portia im glad whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow my covers are drawn back but there is no sign of the redheaded avox girl i wish i knew her name i should have asked it she could write it down maybe or act it out but perhaps that would only result in punishment for her i take a shower and scrub the gold paint the makeup the scent of beauty from my body all that remains of the design teams efforts are the flames on my nails i decide to keep them as reminder of who i am to the audience katniss the girl who was on fire perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the days to come i pull on a thick fleecy nightgown and climb into bed it takes me about five seconds to reali ze ill never fall asleep and i need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment i give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death its no good one hour two three pass and my eyelids refuse to get heavy i cant stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain ill be thrown into desert swamp a frigid wasteland above all i am hoping for trees which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the games resolve too quickly without them but what will the climate be like what traps have the gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower moments and then there are my fellow tributes the more anxious i am to find sleep the more it eludes me finally i am too restless to even stay in bed i pace the floor heart beating too fast breathing too short my room feels like a prison cell if i dont get air soon im going to start to throw things again i run down the hall to the door to the roof its not only unlocked but ajar perhaps someone forgot to close it but it doesnt matter the energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape and im not looking to escape only to fill my lungs
2 with air i want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me the roof is not lit at night but as soon as my bare feel reach its tiled surface i see his silhouette black against the lights that shine endlessly in the capitol theres quite a commotion going on down in the streets music and singing and car horns none of which i could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room i could
9 slip away now without him noticing me he wouldnt hear me over the din but the night airs so sweet i cant bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room and what difference does it make whether we speak or not my feet move soundlessly across the tiles im only yard behind him when i say you should be getting some sleep he starts but doesnt turn i can see him give his head a slight shake i didnt want to miss the party its for us after all i come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail the wide streets are full of dancing people i squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail are they in costumes who could tell peeta answers with all the cra zy clothes they wear here couldnt sleep either couldnt turn my mind off i say thinking about your family he asks no i admit a bit guiltily all i can do is wonder about tomorrow which is pointless of course in the light from below i can see his face now the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands i really am sorry about your hands it doesnt matter katniss he says ive never been a contender in these games anyway thats no way to be thinking i say why not its true my best hope is to not disgrace myself and he hesitates and what i say i dont know how to say it exactly only i want to die as myself does that make any sense he asks i shake my head how could he die as anyone but himself i dont want them to change me in there turn me into some kind of monster that im not i bite my lip feeling inferior while ive been ruminating on the availability of trees peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity his purity of self do you mean you wont kill anyone i ask no when the time comes im sure ill kill just like everybody else i cant go down without a fight only i keep wishing i could think of a way to to show the capitol they dont own me that im more than just a piece in their games says peeta but youre not i say none of us are thats how the games work okay but within that framework theres still you theres still me he insists dont you see a little only no offense but who cares peeta i say i do i mean what else am i allowed to care about at this point he asks angrily hes locked those blue eyes on mine now demanding an answer i take a step back care about what haymitch said about staying alive peeta smiles at me sad and mocking okay thanks for the tip sweetheart its like a slap in the face his use of haymitchs patroni zing endearment look if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena thats your choice i want to spend mine in district twelve wouldnt surprise me if you do says peeta give my mother my best when you make it back will you count on it i say then i turn and leave the roof i spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a do ze imagining the cutting remarks i will make to peeta mellark in the morning peeta mellark we will see how high and mighty he is when hes faced with life and death hell probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes the kind who tries to eat someones
27 heart after theyve killed them there was a guy like that a few years ago from district called titus he went completely savage and the gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players hed killed before he ate them there are no rules in the arena but cannibalism doesnt play well with the capitol audience so they tried to head it off there was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic i dont see peeta in the morning cinna comes to me before dawn gives me a simple shift to wear and guides me to the roof my final dressing and preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the arena itself a hovercraft appears out of thin air just like the one did in the woods the day i saw the redheaded avox girl captured and a ladder drops down i place my hands and feet on the lower  rungs and instantly its as if im fro zen some sort of current glues me to the ladder while im lifted safely inside i expect the ladder to release me then but im still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe "this is just your tracker katniss the stiller you are the more efficiently i can place it " she says still im a statue but that doesnt prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm now the gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena wouldnt want to lose a tribute as soon as the trackers in place the ladder releases me the woman disappears and cinna is retrieved from the roof an avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out despite the tension in my stomach i eat as much as i can although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me im so nervous i could be eating coal dust the one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond this is what birds see only theyre free and safe the very opposite of me the ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out suggesting that were nearing the arena the hovercraft lands and cinna and i go back to the ladder only this time it leads down into a tube underground into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena we follow instructions to my destination a chamber for my preparation in the capitol they call it the launch room in the districts its referred to as the stockyard the place animals go before slaughter everything is brand new i will be the first and only tribute to use this launch room the arenas are historic sites preserved after the games popular destinations for capitol residents to visit
16 to vacation go for a month rewatch the games tour the catacombs visit the sites where the deaths took place you can even take part in reenactments they say the food is excellent i struggle to keep my breakfast down as i shower and clean my teeth cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back then the clothes arrive the same for every tribute cinna has had no say in my outfit does not even know what will be in the package but he helps me dress in the undergarments simple tawny pants light green blouse sturdy brown belt and thin hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs the material in the jackets designed to reflect body heat expect some cool nights he says the boots worn over skintight socks are better than i could have hoped for soft leather not unlike my ones at home these have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though good for running i think im finished when cinna pulls the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket i had completely forgotten about it where did you get that i ask off the green outfit you wore on the train he says i remember now taking it off my mothers dress pinning it to the shirt its your district token right i nod and he fastens it on my shirt it barely cleared the review board some thought the pin could be used as a weapon giving you an unfair advantage but eventually they let it through says cinna they eliminated a ring from that district one girl though if you twisted the gemstone a spike popped out poisoned one she claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did but she lost her token there youre all set move around make sure everything feels comfortable i walk run in a circle swing my arms about yes its fine fits perfectly then theres nothing to do but wait for the call says cinna unless you think you could eat any more i turn down food but accept a glass of water that i take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch i dont want to chew on my nails or lips so i find myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek it still hasnt fully healed from a few days ago soon the taste of blood fills my mouth nervousness seeps into terror as i anticipate what is to come i could be dead flat out dead in an hour not even my fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman injected the tracking device i press on it even though it hurts i press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form do you want to talk katniss cinna asks i shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to him cinna encloses it in both of his and this is how we sit until a pleasant female
15 voice announces its time to prepare for launch still clenching one of cinnas hands i walk over and stand on the circular metal plate remember what haymitch said run find water the rest will follow he says i nod and
28 remember this im not allowed to bet but if i could my money would be on you truly i whisper truly says cinna he leans down and kisses me on the forehead good luck girl on fire and then a glass cylinder is lowering around me breaking our handhold cutting him off from me he taps his fingers under his chin head high i lift my chin and stand as straight as i can the cylinder begins to rise for maybe fifteen seconds im in darkness and then i can feel the metal plate pushing me out of the cylinder into the open air for a moment my eyes are da z zled by the bright sunlight and im conscious only of a strong wind with the hopeful smell of pine trees then i hear the legendary announcer claudius templesmith as his voice booms all around me ladies and gentlemen let the seventy fourth hunger games begin  sixty seconds thats how long were required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us step off before the minute is up and land mines blow your legs off sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the cornucopia a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high spilling over with the things that will give us life here in the arena food containers of water weapons medicine garments fire starters strewn around the cornucopia are other supplies their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn for instance only a few steps from my feet lays a three foot square of plastic certainly it could be of some use in a downpour but there in the mouth i can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather if i had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty three tributes which i have been instructed not to do were on a flat open stretch of ground a plain of hard packed dirt behind the tributes across from me i can see nothing indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff to my right lies a lake to my left and back spars piney woods this is where haymitch would want me to go immediately i hear his instructions in my head just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water but its tempting so tempting when i see the bounty waiting there before me and i know that if i dont get it someone else will that the career tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life sustaining spoils something catches my eye there resting on a mound of blanket rolls is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow already strung just waiting to be engaged thats mine i think its meant for me im fast i can sprint faster than any of the girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races but this forty yard length this is what i am built for i know i can get it i know i can reach it first but then the question is how quickly can i get out of there by the time ive scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons others will have reached the horn and one or two i might be able to pick off but say theres a do zen at that close range they could take me down with the spears and the clubs or their own powerful fists still i wont be the only target im betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl even one who scored an eleven in training to take out their more fierce adversaries haymitch has never seen me run maybe if he had hed tell me to go for it get the weapon since thats the very weapon that might be my salvation and i only see one bow in that whole pile i know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and i find myself positioning my feet
23 to run not away into the stir rounding forests but toward the pile toward the bow when suddenly i notice peeta hes about five tributes to my right quite a fair distance still i can tell hes looking at me and i think he might be shaking his head but the suns in my eyes and while im pu z zling over it the gong rings out and ive missed it ive missed my chance because those extra couple of seconds ive lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in my feet shuffle for a moment confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then i lunge forward scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread the pickings are so small and im so angry with peeta for distracting me that i sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because i cant stand leaving with virtually nothing a boy i think from district reaches the pack at the same time i do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs splattering my face with blood i stagger back repulsed by the warm sticky spray then the boy slips to the ground thats when i see the knife in his back already other tributes have reached the cornucopia and are spreading out to attack yes the girl from district ten yards away running toward me one hand clutching a half do zen knives ive seen her throw in training she never misses and im her next target all the general fear ive been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl this
17 predator who might kill me in seconds adrenaline shoots through me and i sling the pack over one shoulder and run full speed for the woods i can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head the blade lodges in the pack both straps on my shoulders now i make for the trees somehow i know the girl will not pursue me that shell be drawn back into the cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone a grin crosses my face thanks for the knife i think at the edge of the woods i turn for one instant to survey the field about a do zen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn several lie dead already on the ground those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me i continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that i think i can maintain for a while for the next few hours i alternate between jogging and walking putting as much distance as i can between myself and my competitors
7 lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from district but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as i walk i fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket i also free the knife its a fine one with a long sharp blade serrated near the handle which will make it handy for sawing through things and slide it into my belt i dont dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet i just keep moving pausing only to check for pursuers i can go a long time i know that from my days in the woods but i will need water that was haymitchs second instruction and since i sort of botched the first i keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it no luck the woods begin to evolve and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees some i recogni ze some completely
6 foreign to me at one point i hear a noise and pull my knife thinking i may have to defend myself but ive only startled a rabbit good to see you i whisper if theres one rabbit there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared the ground slopes down i dont particularly like this valleys make me feel trapped i want to be high like in the hills around district where i can see my enemies approaching but i have no choice but to keep going funny though i dont feel too bad the days of gorging myself have paid off ive got staying power even though im short on sleep being in the woods is rejuvenating im glad for the solitude even though its an illusion because im probably on screen right now not consistently but off and on there are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking through the woods isnt much to look at but theyll show me enough to let people know im alive uninjured and on the move one of the heaviest days of betting is the opening when the initial casualties come in but that cant compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players its late afternoon when i begin to hear the cannons each shot represents a dead tribute the fighting must have finally stopped at the cornucopia they never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed on the opening day they dont even fire the cannons until the initial fightings over because its too hard to keep track of the fatalities i allow myself to pause panting as i count the shots one two three on and on until they reach eleven eleven dead in all thirteen left to play my fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from district coughed into my face hes gone certainly i wonder about peeta has he lasted through the day ill know in a few hours when they project the deads images into the sky for the rest of us to see all of a sudden im overwhelmed by the thought that peeta may be already lost bled white collected and in the process of being transported back to the capitol to be cleaned up redressed and shipped in a simple wooden box back to district no longer hereheading home i try hard to remember if i saw him once the action started but the last image i can conjure up is peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out maybe its better if hes gone already he had no confidence he could win and i will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him maybe its better if hes out of this for good i slump down next to my pack exhausted i need to go through it anyway before night falls see what i have to work with as i unhook the straps i can feel its sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color this orange will practically glow in the dark i make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow i flip open the flap what i want most right at this moment is water haymitchs directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary i wont last long without it for a few days ill be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration but
20 after that ill deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week tops i carefully lay out the provisions one thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal a pack of crackers a pack of dried beef strips a bottle of iodine a box of wooden matches a small coil of wire a pair of sunglasses and a half gallon plastic bottle with a cap for carrying water thats bone dry no water how hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle i become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth the cracks in my lips ive been moving all day long its been hot and ive sweat a lot i do this at home but there are always streams to drink from or snow to melt if it should come to it as i refill my pack i have an awful thought the lake the one i saw while i was waiting for the gong to sound what if thats the only water source in the arena that way theyll guarantee drawing us in to fight the lake is a full days journey from where i sit now a much harder journey with nothing to drink and then even if i reach it its sure to be heavily guarded by some of the career tributes im about to panic when i remember the rabbit i startled earlier today it has to drink too i just have to find out where twilight
28 is closing in and i am ill at ease the trees are too thin to offer much concealment the layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when i need their trails to find water and im still heading downhill deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless im hungry too but i dont dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet instead i take my knife and go to work on a pine tree cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark i slowly chew the stuff as i walk along after a week of the finest food in the world its a little hard to choke down but ive eaten plenty of pine in my life ill adjust quickly in another hour its clear ive got to find a place to camp night creatures are coming out i can hear the occasional hoot or howl my first clue that ill be competing with natural predators for the rabbits as to whether ill be viewed
28 as a source of food its too soon to tell there could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment but right now i decide to make my fellow tributes a priority im sure many will continue hunting through the night those who fought it out at the cornucopia will have food an abundance of water from the lake
8 torches or flashlights and weapons theyre itching to use i can only hope ive traveled far and fast enough to be out of range before settling down i take my wire and set two twitch up snares in the brush i know its risky to be setting traps but food will go so fast out here and i cant set snares on the run still i walk another five minutes before making camp i pick my tree carefully a willow not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows offering concealment in those long flowing tresses i climb up sticking to the stronger branches close to the trunk and find a sturdy fork for my bed it takes some doing but i arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner i place my backpack in the foot of the bag then slide in after it as a precaution i remove my belt loop it all
8 the way around the branch and my sleeping bag and refasten it at my waist now if i roll over in my sleep i wont go crashing to the ground im small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head but i put on my hood as well as night falls the air is cooling quickly despite the risk i took in getting the backpack i know now it was the right choice this sleeping bag radiating back and preserving my body heat will be invaluable im sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas i may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep if only i wasnt so thirsty night has just come when i hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap through the branches i can see the seal of the capitol which appears to be floating in the sky im actually viewing another screen an enormous one thats transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft the anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment at home we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing but thats thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes for instance if i got my hands on the bow and shot someone my secret would be revealed to all no here in the arena all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores simple head shots but now instead of scores they post only district numbers i take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers the first to appear is the girl from district that means that the career tributes from and have all survived no surprise there then the boy from i didnt expect that one usually all the careers make it through the first day the boy from district  i guess the fox faced girl made it both tributes from and the boy from both from yes theres the boy who i fought for the backpack ive run through my fingers only one more dead tribute to go is it peeta no theres the girl from district thats it the capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume im relieved peetas alive i tell myself again that if i get killed his winning will benefit my mother and prim the most this is what i tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when i think of peeta the gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview the anger at his superiority on the roof the dread that we may come face to face at any moment in this arena eleven dead but none from district i try to work out who is left five career tributes foxface thresh and rue rue so she made it through the first day after all i cant help feeling glad that makes ten of us the other three ill figure out tomorrow now when it is dark and i have traveled far and i am nestled high in this tree now i must try and rest i havent really slept in two days and then theres been the long days journey into the arena slowly i allow my muscles to relax my eyes to close the last thing i think is its lucky i dont snore snap the sound of a breaking branch wakes me how long have i been asleep four hours five the tip of my nose is icy cold snap snap whats going on this is not the sound of a branch under someones foot but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree snap snap i
9 judge it to be several hundred yards to my right slowly noiselessly i turn myself in that direction for a few minutes theres nothing but blackness and some scuffling then i see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom a pair of hands warms over flames but i cant make out more than that i have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name i know at the fire starter what are they thinking a fire ill just at nightfall would have been one thing those who battled at the cornucopia with their superior strength and surplus of supplies they couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then but now when theyve probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims you might as well be waving a flag and shouting come and get me and here i am a stones throw from the biggest idiot in the games strapped in a tree not daring to flee since my general location has
15 just been broadcast to any killer who cares i mean i know its cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag but then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn i lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if i can get out of this tree i wont have the least problem taking out my new neighbor my instinct has been to flee not fight but obviously this persons a ha zard stupid people are dangerous and this one probably doesnt have much in the way of weapons while ive got this excellent knife the sky is still dark but i can feel the first signs of dawn approaching im beginning to think we meaning the person whose death im now devising and me we might actually have gone unnoticed then i hear it several pairs of feet breaking into a run the fire starter must
25 have do zed off theyre on her before she can escape i know its a girl now i can tell by the pleading the agoni zed scream that follows then theres laughter and congratulations from several voices someone cries out twelve down and eleven to go which gets a round of appreciative hoots so theyre fighting in a pack im not really surprised often alliances are formed in the early stages of the games the strong band together to hunt down the weak then when the tension becomes too great begin to turn on one another i dont have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance itll be the remaining career tributes from districts and two boys and three girls the ones who lunched together for a moment i hear them checking the girl for supplies i can tell by their comments theyve found nothing good i wonder if the victim is rue but quickly dismiss the thought shes much too bright to be building a fire like that better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking im almost certain thats the brutish boy from district there
20 are murmurs of assent and then to my horror i hear the pack heading toward me they do not know im here how could they and im well concealed in the clump of trees at least while the sun stays down then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble if they just keep moving they will pass me and be gone in a minute but the careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree they have flashlights torches i can see an arm here a boot there through the breaks in the branches i turn to stone not even daring to breathe have they spotted me no not yet i
18 can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now id say yes nothing to prevent them from going in immediately unless she isnt dead shes dead i stuck her myself then wheres the cannon someone should go back make sure the jobs done yeah we dont want to have to track her down twice i said shes dead an argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others were wasting time ill go finish her and lets move on i almost fall out of the tree the voice belongs to peeta  thank goodness i had the foresight to belt myself in ive rolled sideways off the fork and im facing the ground held in place by the belt one hand and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag braced against the trunk there must have been some rustling when i tipped sideways but the careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it go on then lover boy says the boy from district see for yourself i just get a glimpse of peeta lit by a torch heading back to the girl by the fire his face is swollen with bruises theres a bloody bandage on one arm and from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat i remember him shaking him his head telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies when all along all along hed planned to throw himself into the thick of things just the opposite of what haymitch had mid him to do okay i can stomach that seeing all those supplies was tempting but this this other thing this teaming up with the career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us no one from district would think of doing such a thing career tributes are overly vicious arrogant better fed but only because theyre the capitols lapdogs universally solidly hated by all but those from their own districts i can imagine the things theyre saying about him back home now and peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace obviously the noble boy on the rooftop was playing just one more game with me but this will be his last i will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his death if i dont kill him first myself the career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot then use hushed voices why dont we just kill him now and get it over with let him tag along whats the harm and hes handy with that knife is he thats news what a lot of interesting things im learning about my friend peeta today besides hes our best chance of finding her it takes me a moment to register that the her theyre referring to is me why you think she bought into that sappy romance stuff she might have seemed pretty simpleminded to me every time i think about her spinning around in that dress i want to puke wish we knew how she got that eleven bet you lover boy knows the sound of peeta returning silences them was she dead asks the boy from district no but she is now says peeta just then the cannon fires ready to move on the career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to break and birdsong fills the air i remain in my awkward position muscles trembling with exertion
28 for a while longer then hoist myself back onto my branch i need to get down to get going but for a moment i lie there digesting what ive heard not only is peeta with the careers hes helping them find me the simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because of her eleven because she can use a bow and arrow which peeta knows better than anyone but he hasnt told them yet is he saving that information because he knows its all that keeps him alive is he still pretending to love me for the audience what is going on in his head suddenly the birds fall silent then one gives a high pitched warning call a single note just like the one gale and i heard when the redheaded avox girl was caught high above the dying campfire a hovercraft materiali zes a set of huge metal teeth drops down slowly gently the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft then it vanishes the birds resume their song move i whisper to myself i wriggle out of my sleeping bag roll it up and place it in the pack i take a deep breath while ive been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me i know they must be tracking me now though the minute i hit the ground im guaranteed a close up the audience will
4 have been beside themselves knowing i was in the tree that i overheard the careers talking that i discovered peeta was with them until i work out exactly how i want to play that id better at least act on top of things not perplexed certainly not confused or frightened no i need to look one step ahead of the game so as i slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light i pause a second giving the cameras time to lock on me then i cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile there let them figure out what that means im about to take off when i think of my snares maybe its imprudent to check them with the others so close but have to too many years of hunting i guess and the lure of possible meat im rewarded with one fine rabbit in no time ive cleaned and gutted the animal leaving the head feet tail skin and innards under a pile of leaves im wishing for a fire eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever a lesson i learned the hard way when i think of the dead tribute i hurry back to her camp sure enough the coals of her dying fire are still hot i cut up the rabbit fashion a spit out of branches and set it over the coals im glad for the cameras now i want sponsors to see i can hunt that im a good bet because i wont be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger while the rabbit cooks i grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack the black tones it down but i feel a layer of mud would definitely help of course to have mud id need water i pull on my gear grab my spit kick some dirt over the coals and take off in the opposite direction the careers went i eat half the rabbit as i go then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later the meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst water is my top priority now as i hike along i feel certain im still holding the screen in the capitol so im careful to continue to hide my emotions but what a good time claudius templesmith must be having with his guest commentators dissecting peetas behavior my reaction what to make of it all has peeta revealed his true colors how does this affect the betting odds will we lose sponsors do we even have sponsors yes i feel certain we do or at least did certainly peeta has thrown a wrench into our star crossed lover dynamic or has he maybe since he hasnt spoken much about me we can still get some mileage out of it maybe people will think its something we plotted together if i seem like it amuses me now the sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it seems overly bright i coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting but its no use its only been a day and im dehydrating fast i try and think of everything i know about finding water it runs downhill so in fact continuing down into this valley isnt a bad thing if i could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation these might help me along but nothing seems to change theres just the slight gradual slope the birds the sameness to the trees as the day wears on i know im headed for trouble what little urine ive been able to pass is a dark brown my head is aching and theres a dry patch on my tongue that
10 refuses to moisten the sun hurts my eyes so i dig out my sunglasses but when i put them on they do something funny to my vision so i just stuff them back in my pack its late afternoon when i think ive found help i spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit to suck the sweet juices from the skins but just as im holding them to my lips i get a hard look at them what i thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape and when i break one open the insides are bloodred i dont recogni ze these berries perhaps they are edible but im guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the gamemakers even the plant instructor in the training center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were percent sure they werent toxic something i already knew but im so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away fatigue is beginning to settle on me but its not the usual tiredness that follows a long hike i have to stop and rest frequently although i know the only cure for what ails me requires continued searching i try a new tactic climbing a tree as high as i dare in my shaky state to look for any signs of water but as far as i can see in any direction theres the same unrelenting stretch of forest determined to go on until nightfall i walk until im stumbling over my own feet exhausted i haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in ive no appetite but i suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth something to do night falls the anthem plays and high in the sky i see the picture of the girl who was apparently from district the one peeta went back to finish off my fear of the career pack is minor compared to my burning thirst besides they were heading away from me and by now they too will have to rest with the scarcity of water they may even have had to return to the lake for refills maybe that is the only course for me as well morning brings distress my heads throbs with every beat of my heart simple movements send stabs of pain through my joints i fall rather than jump from the tree it takes several minutes for me to assemble my gear somewhere inside me i know this is wrong i should be acting with more caution moving with more urgency but my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard i lean back against the trunk of my tree one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue as i assess my options how can i get water return to the lake no good id never make it hope for rain theres not a cloud in the sky keep looking yes this is my only chance but then another thought hits me and the surge of anger that follows brings me to me senses haymitch he could send me water press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes i know i must have sponsors at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me yes its pricey but these people theyre made of money and theyll be betting on me as well perhaps haymitch doesnt reali ze how deep my need is i say in a voice as loud as i dare water i wait hopefully for a parachute to descend from the sky but nothing is forthcoming something is wrong am i deluded about having sponsors or has peetas behavior made them all hang back no i dont believe it theres someone out there who wants to buy me water only haymitch is refusing to let it go through as my mentor he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors i know he hates me hes made that clear enough but enough to let me die from this he cant do that
27 can he if a mentor mistreats his tributes hell be held accountable by the viewers by the people back in district even haymitch wouldnt risk that would he say what you will about my fellow traders in the hob but i dont think theyd welcome him back there if he let me die this way and then where would he get his liquor so what is he trying to make me suffer for defying him
30 is he directing all the sponsors toward peeta is he just too drunk to even notice whats going on at the moment somehow i dont believe that and i dont believe hes trying to kill me off by neglect either he has in fact in his own unpleasant way genuinely been trying to prepare me for this then what is going on i bury my face in my hands theres no danger of tears now i couldnt produce one to save my life what is haymitch doing despite my anger hatred and suspicions a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer maybe hes sending you a message it says a message saying what then i know theres only one good reason haymitch could be withholding water from me because he knows ive almost found it i grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet my backpack seems to have tripled in weight i find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and i start off the suns beating down even more searing than the first two days i feel like an old piece of leather drying and cracking in the heat every step is an effort but i refuse to stop i refuse to sit down if i sit theres a good chance i wont be able to get up again that i wont even remember my task what easy prey i am any tribute even tiny rue could take me right now merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife and id have little strength to resist but if anyone is in my part of the woods they ignore me the truth is i feel a million miles from another living soul not alone though no theyve surely got a camera tracking me now i think back to the years of watching tributes starve free ze bleed and dehydrate to death unless theres a really good fight going on somewhere im being featured my thoughts turn to prim its likely she wont be watching me live but theyll show updates at the school during lunch for her sake i try to look as least desperate as i can but by afternoon i know the end is coming my legs are shaking and my heart too quick i keep forgetting exactly what im doing ive stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet but when the stick slides out from under me i finally tumble to the ground unable to get up i let my eyes close i have misjudged haymitch he has no intention of helping me at all this is all right i think this is not so bad here the air is less hot signifying evenings approach theres a slight sweet scent that reminds me of lilies my fingers stroke the smooth ground sliding easily across the top this is an okay place to die i think my fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool slippery earth i love mud i think how many times ive tracked game with the help of its soft readable surface good for bee stings too mud mud mud my eyes fly open and i dig my fingers into the earth it is mud my nose lifts in the air and those are lilies pond lilies i crawl now through the mud dragging myself toward the scent five yards from where i fell i crawl through a tangle of plants into a
2 pond floating on the top yellow flowers in bloom are my beautiful lilies its all i can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as i can hold but i have just enough sense left to abstain with trembling hands i get out my flask and fill it with water i add what i remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it the half an hour of waiting is agony but i do it at least i think its a half an hour but its certainly as long as i can stand slowly easy now i tell myself i take one swallow and make myself wait then another over the next couple of hours i drink the entire half gallon then a second i prepare another before i retire to a tree where i continue sipping eating rabbit and even indulge in one of my precious crackers by the time the anthem plays i feel remarkably better there are no faces tonight no tributes died today tomorrow ill stay here resting camouflaging my backpack with mud catching some of those little fish i saw as i sipped digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal i snuggle down in my sleeping bag hanging on to my water bottle for dear life which of course it is a few hours later the stampede of feet shakes me from slumber i look around in bewilderment its not yet dawn but my stinging eyes can see it it would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me  my first impulse is to scramble from the tree but im belted in somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and i fall to the ground in a heap still snarled in my sleeping bag theres no time for any kind of packing fortunately my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag i shove in the belt hoist the bag over my shoulder and flee
24 the world has transformed to flame and smoke burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet all i can do is follow the others the rabbits and deer and i even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods i trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine but they are much faster flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs that theres no way i can keep apace with them the heat is horrible but worse than the heat is the smoke which threatens to suffocate me at any moment i pull the top of my shirt up over my nose grateful to find it soaked in sweat and it offers a thin veil of protection and i run choking my bag banging against my back my face cut with branches that materiali ze from the gray ha ze without warning because i know i am supposed to run this was no tributes campfire gone out of control no accidental occurrence the flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height a uniformity that marks them as human made machine made gamemaker made things have been too quiet today no deaths perhaps no fights at all the audience in the capitol will be getting bored claiming that these games are verging on dullness this is the one thing the games must not do its not hard to follow the gamemakers motivation there is the career pack and then there are the rest of us probably spread far and thin across the arena this fire is designed to flush us out to drive us together it may not be the most original device ive seen but its very very effective i hurdle over a burning log not high enough the tail end of my jacket catches on fire and i have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames but i dont dare leave the jacket scorched and smoldering as it is i take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag hoping the lack of air will quell what i havent extinguished this is all i have what i carry on my back and its little enough to survive with in a matter of minutes my throat and nose are burning the coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest i manage to take cover under a stone
30 outcropping just as the vomiting begins and i lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach crouching on my hands and knees i retch until theres nothing left to come up i know i need to keep moving but im trembling and light headed now gasping for air i allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle you get one minute i tell myself one minute to rest i take the time to reorder my supplies wad up the sleeping bag and messily stuff everything into the backpack my minutes up i know its time to move on but the smoke has clouded my thoughts the swift footed animals that were my compass have left me behind i know i havent been in this part of the woods before there were no si zable rocks like the one im sheltering against on my earlier travels where are the gamemakers driving me back to the lake to a whole new terrain filled with new dangers i had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attack began would there be any way i could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there to a source of water at least the wall of fire must have an end and it wont burn indefinitely not because the gamemakers couldnt keep it fueled but because again that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience if i could get back behind the fire line i could avoid meeting up with the careers ive just decided to try and loop back around although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head i spring out from under my ledge energi zed by renewed fear the game has taken a twist the fire was just to get us moving now the audience will get to see some real fun when i hear the next hiss i flatten on the ground not taking time to look the fireball hits a tree off to my left engulfing it in flames to remain still is death im barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where i was lying sending a pillar of fire up behind me time loses meaning now as i frantically try to dodge the attacks i cant see where theyre being launched from but its not a hovercraft the angles are not extreme enough probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks somewhere in a cool and spotless room a gamemaker sits at a set of controls fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second all that is needed is a direct hit whatever 
25 vague plan i had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as i  zig zag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs each one is only the si ze of an apple but packs tremendous power on contact
24every sense i have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one when theres a hiss i act or die something keeps me moving forward though a lifetime of watching the hunger games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks and that if i can just get away from this section i might be able to move out of reach of the launchers i might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers but i cant worry about that now how
17 long i scramble along dodging the fireballs i cant say but the attacks finally begin to abate which is good because im retching again this time its an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well im forced to stop as my body convulses trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons ive been sucking in during the attack i wait for the next hiss the next signal to bolt it doesnt come the force of the retching has squee zed tears out of my stinging eyes my clothes are drenched in sweat somehow through the smoke and vomit i pick up the scent of singed hair my hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers i stare at them fascinated by the transformation when the hissing registers my muscles react only not fast enough this time the fireball crashes into the ground at my side but not before it skids across my right calf seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge i twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet shrieking trying to remove myself from the horror when i finally regain enough sense i roll the leg back and forth on the ground which stifles the worst of it but then without thinking i rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands i sit on the ground a few yards from the bla ze set off by the fireball my calf is
18 screaming my hands covered in red welts im shaking too hard to move if the gamemakers want to finish me off now is the time i hear cinnas voice carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems katniss the girl who was on fire what a good laugh the gamemakers
3 must be having over that one perhaps cinnas beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me i know he couldnt have foreseen this must be hurting for me because in fact i believe he cares about me but all in all maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me the attack is now over the gamemakers dont want me dead not yet anyway everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong the real sport of the hunger games is watching the tributes kill one another every so often they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can but mostly they manipulate us into confronting one another face to face which means if i am no longer being fired at there is at least one other tribute close at hand i would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if i could but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me i make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky it does not seem to be pursuing me any longer except with its stinking black clouds another light daylight begins to softly emerge swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams my visibility is poor i can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction a tribute could easily be concealed from me here i should draw my knife as a precaution but i doubt my ability to hold it for long the pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf i hate burns have always hated them even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven it is the worst kind of pain to me but i have never experienced anything like this im so weary i dont even notice im in the pool until im ankle deep its spring fed bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks and blissfully cool i plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief isnt that what my mother always says the first treatment for a burn is cold water that it draws out the heat but she means minor burns probably shed recommend it for my hands but what of my calf although i have not
25 yet had the courage to examine it im guessing that its an injury in a whole different class i lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while dangling my hands in the water examining the little flames on my fingernails that are beginning to chip off good ive had enough fire for a lifetime i bathe the blood and ash from my face i try to recall all i know about burns they are common injuries in the seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal then there are the mine accidents a family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him the district doctor whos responsible for treating the miners had written him off told the family to take him home to die but they wouldnt accept this he lay on our kitchen table senseless to the world i got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh gaping charred flesh burned clear down to the bone before i ran from the house i went to the woods and hunted the entire day haunted by the gruesome leg memories of my fathers death whats funny was prim whos scared of her own shadow stayed and helped my mother says healers are born not made they did their best but the man died just like the doctor said he would my leg is in need of attention but i still cant look at it what if its as bad as the mans and i can see my bone then i remember my mother saying that if a burns severe the victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed encouraged by this i sit up and swing my leg in front of me i almost faint at the sight of my calf the flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters i force myself to take deep slow breaths feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face i cant show weakness at this injury not if i want help pity does not get you aid admiration at your refusal to give in does i cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely the burned area is about the si ze of my hand none of the skin is blackened i think its not too bad to soak gingerly i stretch out my leg into the pool propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden and sigh because this does offer some relief i know there are herbs if i could find them that would speed the healing but i cant quite call them to mind water and time will probably be all i have to work with should i be moving on the smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy if i do continue away from the fire wont i be walking straight into the weapons of the careers besides every time
29 i lift my leg from the water the pain rebounds so intensely i have to slide it back in my hands are slightly less demanding they can handle small breaks from the pool so i slowly put my gear back in order first i fill my bottle with the
26 pool water treat it and when enough time has passed begin to rehydrate my body after a time i force myself to nibble on a cracker which helps settle my stomach i roll up my sleeping bag except for a few black marks its relatively unscathed my jackets another matter stinking and scorched at least a foot of the back beyond repair i cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs but the hoods intact and its
10 far better than nothing despite the pain drowsiness begins to take over id take to a tree and try to rest except id be too easy to spot besides abandoning my pool seems impossible i neatly arrange my supplies even settle my pack on my shoulders but i cant seem to leave i spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit sip water watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky where would i go anyway that is any safer than here i lean back on my pack overcome by drowsiness if the careers want me let them find me i think before drifting into a stupor let them find me and find me they do its lucky im ready to move on because when i hear the feet i have less than a minute head start evening has begun to fall the moment i awake im up and running splashing across the pool flying into the underbrush my leg slows me down but i sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire either i hear their coughs their raspy voices calling to one another still they are closing in just like a pack of wild dogs and so i do what i have done my whole life in such circumstances i pick a high tree and begin to climb if running hurt climbing is agoni zing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark im fast though and by the time theyve reached the base of my trunk im twenty feet up for a moment we stop and survey one another i hope they cant hear the pounding of my heart this could be it i think what chance do i have against them all six are there the five careers and peeta and my only consolation is theyre pretty beat up too even so look at their weapons look at their faces grinning and snarling at me a sure kill above them it seems pretty hopeless but then something else registers theyre bigger and stronger than i am no doubt but theyre also heavier theres a reason its me and not gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit or rob the most remote bird nests i must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest career now i smile hows everything with you i call down cheerfully this takes them aback but i know the crowd will love it well enough says the boy from district yourself its been a bit warm for my taste i say i can almost hear the laughter from the capitol the airs better up here why dont you come on up think i will says the same boy here take this cato says the girl from district and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows my bow my arrows just the sight of them makes me so angry i want to scream at myself at that traitor peeta for distracting me from having them i try to make eye contact with him now but he seems to
11 be intentionally avoiding my ga ze as he polishes his knife with the edge of his shirt no says cato pushing away the bow ill do better with my sword i can see the weapon a short heavy blade at his belt i give cato time to hoist himself into the tree before i begin to climb again gale
26 always says i remind him of a squirrel the way i can scurry up even the slenderest limb part of its my weight but part of its practice you have to know where to place your hands and feet im another thirty feet in the air when i hear the crack and look down to see cato flailing as he and a branch go down he hits the ground hard and im hoping he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet swearing like a fiend the girl with the arrows glimmer i hear someone call her ugh the names the people in district give their children are so ridiculous anyway glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop im at least eighty feet high now she tries to shoot me and its immediately evident that shes incompetent with a bow one of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and im able to sei ze it i wave it teasingly above her head as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it when actually i mean to use it if i ever get the chance i could kill them everyone of them if those silver weapons were in my hands the careers regroup on the ground and i can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves furious i have made them look foolish but twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing finally i hear peeta say harshly oh let her stay up there its not like shes going anywhere well deal with her in the morning well hes right about one thing im going nowhere all the relief from the pool water has gone leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns i scoot down to a fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed put on my jacket lay out my sleeping bed belt myself in and try to keep from moaning the heat of the bags too much for my leg i cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air i dri z zle water on the wound my hands all my bravado is gone im weak from pain and hunger but cant bring myself to eat even if i can last the night what will the morning bring i stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest but the burns forbid it birds are settling down for the night singing lullabies to their young night creatures emerge an owl hoots the faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke the eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree a possum maybe catching the firelight from the careers torches suddenly im up on one elbow those are no possums eyes i know their glassy reflection too well in fact those are not animal eyes at all in the last dim rays of light i make her out watching me silently from between the branches rue how long has she been here the whole time probably still and unobserved as the action
8 unfolded beneath her perhaps she headed up her tree shortly before i did hearing the pack was so close for a while we hold each others ga ze then without even rustling a leaf her little hand slides into the open and points to something above my head  my eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me at first i have no idea what shes pointing to but then about fifteen feet up i make out the vague shape in the dimming light but of of what some sort of animal it looks about the si ze of a raccoon but it hangs from the bottom of a branch swaying ever so slightly theres something else among the familiar evening sounds of the woods my ears register a low hum then i know its a wasp nest fear shoots through me but i have enough sense to keep still after all i dont know what kind of wasp lives there it could be the ordinary leave us alone and well leave you alone type but these are the hunger games and ordinary isnt the norm more likely they will be one of the capitols muttations tracker jackers like the jabberjays these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed like land mines around the districts during the war larger than regular wasps they have a distinctive solid gold body and a sting that raises a lump the si ze of a plum on contact most people cant tolerate more than a few stings some die at once if you live the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness and theres another thing these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to kill them thats where the tracker part of the name comes from after the war the capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city but the ones near the districts were left untouched another reminder of our weakness i suppose just like the hunger games another reason to keep inside the fence of district when gale and i come across a tracker jacker nest we immediately
13 head in the opposite direction so is that what hangs above me i look back to rue for help but shes melted into her tree given my circumstances i guess it doesnt matter what type of wasp nest it is im wounded and trapped darkness has given me a brief reprieve but by the time the sun rises the careers will have formulated a plan to kill me theres no way they could do otherwise after ive made them look so stupid that nest may be the sole option i have left if i can drop it down on them i may be able to escape but ill risk my life in the process of course ill never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest to cut it free ill have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down the serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that but can my hands and will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm and what if the careers figure out what im doing and move their camp that would defeat the whole purpose i reali ze that the best chance ill have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during the anthem that could begin any time i drag myself out of my bag make sure my knife is secured in my belt and begin to make my way up the tree this in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me but i persevere when i reach the limb that supports the nest the
19 humming becomes more distinctive but its still oddly subdued if these are tracker jackers its the smoke i think its sedated them this was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps the seal of the capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out its now or never i think and begin to saw blisters burst on my right hand as i awkwardly drag the knife back and forth once ive got a groove the work requires less effort but is almost more than i can handle i grit my teeth and saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today thats all right the audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me but the anthems running out and im only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends the sky goes dark and im forced to stop now what i could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan if the wasps are too groggy if the nest catches on its way down if i try to escape this could all be a deadly waste of time better i think to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies in the faint light of the careers torches i inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise ive ever had sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute my
4 first gift from a sponsor haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem the pot easily fits in the palm of my hand what can it be not food surely i unscrew the lid and i know by the scent that its medicine cautiously i probe the surface of the ointment the throbbing in my fingertip vanishes oh haymitch i whisper thank you he has not abandoned me not left me to fend entirely for myself the cost of this medicine must be astronomical probably not one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot to me it is priceless i dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf the effect is almost magical erasing the pain on contact leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind this is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants its high tech medicine brewed up in the capitols labs when my calf is treated i rub a thin layer into my hands after wrapping the pot in the parachute i nestle it safely away in my pack now that the pain has eased its all i can do to reposition myself in my bag before i plunge into sleep a bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning in the gray morning light i examine my hands the medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby skin pink my leg still feels inflamed but that burn was far deeper i apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear whatever happens im going to have to move and move fast i also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday and im already starting to feel the effects of hunger below me i can see the career pack and peeta asleep on the ground by her position leaning up against the trunk of the tree id guess glimmer was supposed to be on guard but fatigue overcame her my eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me but i cant make out rue since she tipped me off it only seems fair to warn her besides if im going to die today its rue i want to win even if it means a little extra food for my family the idea of peeta being crowned victor is unbearable i call rues name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear wide and alert at once she points up to the nest again i hold up my knife and make a sawing motion she nods and disappears theres a rustling in a nearby tree then the same noise again a bit farther off i reali ze shes leaping from tree to tree its all i can do not to laugh out loud is this what she showed the gamemakers i imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor she should have gotten at least a ten rosy streaks are breaking through in the east i cant afford to wait any longer compared to the agony of last nights climb this one is a cinch at the tree limb that holds the nest i position the knife in the groove and im about to
6 draw the teeth across the wood when i see something moving there on the nest the bright gold gleam of a tracker jacker la zily making its way across the papery gray surface no question its acting a little subdued but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands beading up through the ointment and i do my best to pat them dry on my shirt if i dont get through this branch in a matter of seconds the entire swarm could emerge and attack me theres no sense in putting it off i take a deep breath grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as i can back forth back forth the tracker
1 jackers begin to bu z z and i hear them coming out back forth back forth a stabbing pain shoots through my knee and i know one has found me and the others will be honing in back forth back forth and just as the knife cuts through i shove the end of the branch as far away from me as i can it crashes down through the lower branches snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground the nest bursts open like an egg and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air i feel a second sting on the cheek a third on my neck and their venom almost immediately makes me woo zy i cling to the tree with one arm while i rip the barbed stingers out of my flesh fortunately only these three tracker jackers had identified me before the nest went down the rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground its mayhem the careers have woken to a full scale tracker jacker attack peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt i can hear cries of to the lake to the lake and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water it must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects glimmer and another girl the one from district are not so lucky they receive multiple stings before theyre even out of my view glimmer appears to go completely mad shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow which is pointless she calls to the others for help but of course no one returns the girl from district staggers out of sight although i wouldnt bet on her making it to the lake i watch glimmer fall twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes and then go still the nest is nothing but an empty shell the wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others i dont think theyll return but i dont want to risk it i scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake the poison from the stingers makes me wobbly but i find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water just in case any wasps are still on my trail after about five minutes i drag myself onto the rocks people have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings actually the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in si ze a foul smelling green liquid oo zes from the places where i pulled out the stingers the swelling the pain the oo ze watching glimmer twitching to death on the ground its a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the hori zon i dont want to think about what glimmer must look like now her body disfigured her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow the bow somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another and im on my feet teetering through the trees back to glimmer the bow the arrows i must get them i havent heard the cannons fire yet so perhaps glimmer is in some sort of coma her heart still struggling
3 against the wasp venom but once it stops and the cannon signals her death a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body taking the only bow and sheath of arrows ive seen out of the games for good and i refuse to let them slip through my fingers again i reach glimmer just as the cannon fires the tracker jackers have vanished this girl so breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews is unrecogni zable her features eradicated her limbs three times their normal si ze the stinger lumps have begun to explode spewing putrid green liquid around her i have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow the sheath of arrows is pinned under her back i try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm but the flesh disintegrates in my hands and i fall back on the ground is this real or have the hallucinations begun i squee ze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth ordering myself not to become sick breakfast must stay down it might be days before i can hunt again a second cannon fires and im guessing the girl from district has just died i hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call which means a hovercraft is about to appear confused i think its for glimmer although this doesnt quite make sense because im still in the picture still fighting for the arrows i lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles in the middle of the sky i spot the hovercraft i throw myself over glimmers body as if to protect it but then i see the girl from district being lifted into the air and vanishing do this i command myself clenching
8 my jaw i dig my hands under glimmers body get a hold on what must be her rib cage and force her onto her stomach i cant help it im hyperventilating now the whole thing is so nightmarish and im losing my grasp on whats real i tug on the silver sheath of arrows but its caught on something her shoulder blade something and finally yank it free ive just encircled the sheath with my arms when i hear the footsteps several pairs coming through the underbrush and i reali ze the careers have come back theyve come back to kill me or get their weapons or both but its too late to run i pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string i see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive i cant do it i cant do it i cant do it im helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees spear lifted poised to throw the shock on peetas face makes no sense to me i wait for the blow instead his arm drops to his side what are you still doing here he hisses at me i stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear his whole body starts sparkling as if hes been dipped in dew are you mad hes prodding me with the shaft of the spear now get up get up i rise but hes still pushing at me what what is going on he shoves me away from him hard run he screams run behind him cato slashes his way through the brush hes sparkling wet too and badly stung under one eye i catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as peeta says holding tightly to my bow and arrows banging into trees that appear out of nowhere tripping and falling as i try to keep my balance back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods the world begins to bend in alarming ways a butterfly balloons to the si ze of a house then shatters into a million stars trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and i cant shake them free theyre climbing up my arms my neck someones screaming a long high pitched scream that never breaks for breath i have a vague idea it might be me i trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest tucking my knees up to my chin i wait for death sick and disoriented im able to form only one thought peeta mellark just saved my life then the ants bore into my eyes and i black out  i enter a nightmare from which i wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me all the things i dread most all the things i dread for others manifest in such vivid detail i cant help but believe theyre real each time i wake i think at last this is over but it isnt its only the beginning of a new chapter of torture how many ways do i watch prim die relive my fathers last moments feel my own body ripped apart this is the nature of the tracker jacker venom so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain when i finally do come to my senses i lie still waiting for the next onslaught of imagery but eventually i accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system
9 leaving my body wracked and feeble im still lying on my side locked in the fetal position i lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound untouched by ants that never existed simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort so many parts of me hurt it doesnt seem worthwhile taking inventory of them very very slowly i manage to sit up im in a shallow hole not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old dead leaves my clothings damp but i dont know whether pond water dew rain or sweat is the cause for a long time all i can do is take tiny sips from my bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush how long have i been out it was morning when i lost reason now its afternoon but the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed even two possibly if so ill have no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker attack not glimmer or the girl from district but there was the boy from district both tributes from district and peeta did they die from the stings certainly if they lived their last days must have been as horrid as my own and what about rue shes so small it wouldnt take much venom to do her in but then again the tracker jackers wouldve had to catch her and she had a good head start a foul rotten taste pervades my mouth and the water has little effect on it i drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower i gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue the sweetness spreads through my mouth down my throat warming my veins with memories of summer and my home woods and gales presence beside me for some reason our discussion from that last morning comes back to me we could do it you know what leave the district run off live in the woods you and i we could make it and suddenly im not thinking of gale but of peeta and  peeta he saved my life i think because by the time we met up i couldnt tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine but if he did and my
24 instincts tell me he did what for is he simply working the lover boy angle he initiated at the interview or was he actually trying to protect me and if he was what was he doing with those careers in the first place none of it makes sense i wonder what gale made of the incident for a moment and then i push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason gale and peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts so i focus on the one really good thing thats happened since i landed in the arena i have a bow and arrows a full do zen arrows if you count the one i retrieved in the tree they bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from glimmers body which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them i can clean them later but i do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree they are more like the weapons in the training center than my ones at home but who cares that i can work with the weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the games i know i have tough opponents left to face but i am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures if cato broke through the trees right now i wouldnt flee id shoot i find im actually anticipating the moment with pleasure but first i have to get some strength back in my body im very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low the little padding i was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the capitol is gone plus several more pounds as well my hip bones and ribs are more prominent than i remember them being since those awful months after my fathers death and then there are my wounds to contend with burns cuts and bruises from smashing into the trees and three tracker jacker stings which are as sore and swollen as ever i treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well but it has no effect on them my mother knew a treatment for them some type of leaf that could draw out the poison but she seldom had cause to use it and i dont even remember its name let alone its appearance water first i think you can hunt along the way now its easy to see the direction i came from by the path of destruction my cra zed body made through the foliage so i walk off in the other direction hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom i cant move too quickly my joints reject any abrupt motions but i establish the slow hunters tread i use when tracking game within a few minutes i spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow its not my usual clean shot through the eye but ill take it after about an hour i find a stream shallow but wide and more than sufficient for my needs the suns hot and severe so while i wait for my water to purify i strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current im filthy from head to toe i try splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns after rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry i sit on the bank in the sun for a bit untangling my hair with my fingers my appetite returns and i eat a cracker and a strip of beef with a handful of moss i polish the blood from my silver weapons refreshed i treat my burns again braid back my hair and dress in the damp clothes knowing the sun will dry them soon enough following the stream against its current seems the smartest course of action im traveling uphill now which i prefer with a source of fresh water not only for myself but possible game i easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey anyway it looks plenty edible to me by late afternoon i decide to build a small fire to cook the meat betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and i can quench the fire by nightfall i clean the game taking extra care with the bird but theres nothing alarming about it once the feathers are plucked its no bigger than a chicken but its plump and firm ive just placed the first lot over the coals when i hear the twig snap in one motion i turn to the sound bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder theres no one there no one i can see anyway then i spot the tip of a childs boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree my shoulders relax and i grin she can move through the woods like a shadow you have to give her that how else could she have followed me the words come out of my mouth before i can stop them you know theyre not the only ones who can form alliances i say for a moment no response then one of rues eyes edges around the trunk you want me for an
11 ally why not you saved me with those tracker jackers youre smart enough to still be alive and i cant seem to shake you anyway i say she blinks at me trying to decide you hungry i can see her swallow hard her eye flickering to the meat come on then ive had two kills today rue tentatively steps out into the open i can fix your stings can you i ask how she digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves im almost certain theyre the ones my mother uses whered you find those just around we all carry them when we work in the orchards they left a lot of nests there says rue there are a lot here too
