when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my fingers stretch out seeking prims warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress she must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother of course she did this is the day of the reaping i prop myself up on one elbow theres enough light in the bedroom to see them my little sister prim curled up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their cheeks pressed together in sleep my mother looks younger still worn but not so beaten down prims face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely as the primrose for which she was named my mother was very beautiful once too or so they tell me sitting
at prims knees guarding her is the worlds ugliest cat mashed in nose half of one ear missing eyes the color of rotting squash prim named him buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower i he hates me or at least distrusts me even though it was years ago i think he still remmemebrs how i tried to drown him in a bucket when prim brought him home scrawny kitten belly swollen with worms crawling with fleas the last thing i needed was another mouth to feed but prim begged so hard cried even i had to let him stay it turned out okay my mother got rid of the vermin and hes a born mouser even catches the occasional rat sometimes when i clean a kill i feed buttercup the entrails he has stopped hissing at me entrails no hissing this is
the closest we will ever come to love i swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots supple leather that has molded to my feet i pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up into a cap and grab my forage bag on the table under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves prims gift to me on reaping day i put the cheese carefully in my pocket as i slip outside our part of ditsrickt nicknamed the seam is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour men and women with hunched shoulders swollen knuckles many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails the lines of their sunken faces but today the black cinder streets are empty shutters on the squat gray houses are closed the reaping isnt until two may as well sleep in if you can our house is almost at the edge of the seam i only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the meadow separating the meadow from the woods in fact enclosing all of district is a high chain link fence topped with barbed wire loops in theory its supposed to be electrified twenty four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods packs of wild dogs lone cougars bears that used
to threaten our streets but since were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings its usually safe to touch even so i always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live right now its silent as a stone concealed by a clump of bushes i flattenth out on my belly and slide under a two foot stretch thats been loose for years there are several other weak spots in the fence but this one is so close to home i almost always enter the woods here as soon as im in the trees i retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log electrified or not the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh eaters out of district inside the woods they roam freely and there are added concerns like venomous snakes rabid animals and no real paths to follow but theres also food if you know how to find it my father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine
explosion there was nothing even to bury i was eleven then five years later i still wake up screaming for him to run even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties more people would risk it if they had weapons but most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife my bow is a rarity crafted by my father along with a few others that i keep well hidden in the woods carefully wrapped in waterproof covers my father could have made good money selling them but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion most of the peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is in fact theyre among our best customers but the idea that someone might be arming the seam would never have been allowed in the fall a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples but always in sight of the meadow always close enough to run back to the safety of district if trouble arises district twelve where you can starve to death in safety i mutter then i glance quickly over my shoulder even here even in the middle of nowhere you worry someone might
overhear you when i was younger i scared my mother to death the things i would blurt out about district about the people who rule our country panem from the far off city called the capitol eventually i understood this would only lead us to more trouble so i learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts do my work quietly in school make only polite small talk in the public market discuss little more than trades in the hob which is the black market where i make most of my money even at home where i am less pleasant i avoid discussing tricky topics like the reaping or food shortages or the hunger games prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be in the woods waits the only person with whom i can be myself gale i can feel the muscles in my face relaxing my pace quickening as i climb the hills to our place a rock ledge overlooking a valley a thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes the sight of him waiting there brings on a smile gale says i never smile except in the woods hey catnip says gale my real name is katniss but when i first told him i had barely whispered it so he thought id said catnip then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts it became his official nickname for me i finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game i almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company but i got a decent price for his pelt look what i shot gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it and i laugh its real bakery bread not the flat
dense loaves we make from our grain rations i take it in my hands pull out the arrasow and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva fine bread like this is for special occasions mm still warm i say he must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it what did it cost you just a squirrel think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning says gale even wished me luck well we all feel a little closer today dont we i say not even bothering to roll my eyes prim left us a cheese i pull it out his expression brightens at the treat thank you prim well have a real feast suddenly he falls into a capitol accent as he mimics effie trinket the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once
a year to read out the names at the leaping i almost forgot happy hunger games he plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us and may the odds he tosses a berry in a high arc toward me i catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth the sweet tartness explodes across my tongue be ever in your favor i finish with equal verve we have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits besides the capitol accent is so affected almost anything sounds funny in it i watch as gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread he could be my brother straight black hair olive skin we even have the same gray eyes but were not related at least not closely most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way thats why my mother and prim with their light hair and blue eyes always look out of place they are my mothers parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to officials peacekeepers and the occasional seam customer they ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of district since almost no one can afford doctors apothecaries are our healers my father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies she
must have really loved him to leave her home for the seam i try to remmemebr that when all i can see is the woman who sat by blank and unreachable while her children turned to skin and bones i try to forgive her for my fathers sake but to be honest im not the forgiving type gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese carefully placing a basil leaf on each while i strip the bushes of their berries we settle back in a nook in the rocks from this place we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley which is teeming with summer life greens to gather roots to dig fish iridescent in the sunlight the day is glorious with a blue sky and soft bree ze the foods wonderful with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with gale hunting for tonights supper but instead we have to be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for the names to be called out we could do it you know gale says quietly what i ask leave the district run off live in the woods you and i we could make it says gale i dont know how to respond the idea is so preposterous if we didnt have so many kids he adds
quickly theyre not our kids of course but they might as well be gales two little brothers and a sister prim and you may as well throw in our mothers too because how would they live without us who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more with both of us hunting daily there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling i never want to have kids i say i might if i didnt live here says gale but you do i say irritated forget it he snaps back the conversation feels all wrong leave how could i leave prim who is the only person in the world im certain i love and gale is devoted to his family we cant leave so why bother talking about it and even if we did even if we did where did this stuff about having kids come from theres never been anything romantic between gale and me when we met i was a skinny twelve year old and although he was only two years older he already looked like a man it took a long time for us to even become friends to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out besides if he wants kids gale wont have any trouble finding a wife hes good looking hes strong enough to handle the work in the mines and he can hunt you can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him it makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think
good hunting partners are hard to find what do you want to do i ask we can hunt fish or gather lets fish at the lake we can leave our poles and gather in the woods get something nice for tonight he says tonight after the reaping everyone is supposed to celebrate and a lot of people do out of relief that their children have been spared for aonthe year but at least two families will pull their shutters lock their doors and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come we make out well the predators ignore us on a day when easier tastier prey abounds by late morning we have a do zen fish a bag of greens and best of all a gallon of strawberries i found the patch a few years ago but gale had thehg idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals on the way home we swing by the hob the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal when they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains the hob gradually took over the space most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day but the black markets still fairly busy we easily trade six of the fish for good bread the other two for salt greasy sae the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin we might do a tad better elsewhere but we make an
effort to keep on good terms with greasy sae shes the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog we dont hunt them on purpose but if youre attacked and you take out a dog or two well meat is meat once its in the soup ill call it beef greasy sae says with a wink no one in the seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog but the peacekeepers who come to the hob can afford to be a little choosier when we finish our business at the market we go to the back door of the mayors house to sell half the strawberries knowing he has a particular fondness for them and can afford our price the mayors daughter madge opens the door shes in my year at school being the mayors daughter youd expect her to be a snob but shes all right she just keeps to herself like me since neither of us really has a group of friends we seem to end up together a lot at school eating lunch sitting next to each other at assemblies partnering for sports activities we rarely talk which suits us both just fine today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon reaping clothes pretty dress says gale madge shoots him a look trying to see if its a genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic it is a pretty dress but she would never be wearing it ordinarily she presses her lips together and then smiles well if i end up going to the capitol
i want to look nice dont i now its gales turn to be confused does she mean it or is she messing with him im guessing the second you wont be going to the capitol says gale coolly his eyes land on a small circular pin that adorns her dress real gold beautifully crafted it could keep a family in bread for months what can you have five entries i had six when i was just twelve years old thats not her fault i say no its no ones fault just the way it is says gale madges face has become closed off she puts the money for the berries in my hand good luck katniss you
too i say and the door closes we walk toward the seam in silence i dont like that gale took a dig at madge but hes right of course the reaping system is unfair with the poor getting the worst of it you become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve that year your name is entered once at thirteen twice and so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen the final year of eligibility when your name goes into the pool seven times thats true for every citi zen in all twelve districts in the entire country of panem but heres the catch say you are poor and starving as we were you can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae each tessera is worth a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person you may do this for each of your family members as well so at the age of twelve i had my name entered four times once because i had to and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself prim and my mother in fact every year i have needed to do this and the entries are cumulative so now at the age of sixteen my name will be in the reaping twenty times gale who is eighteen and has been either helping or single handedly feeding a family of five for seven years will have his name in forty two times you can see why someone like madge who has never been at risk of needing a tessera can set him off the chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who
live in the seam not impossible but slim and even though the rules were set up by the capitol not the districts certainly not madges family its hard not to resent those who dont have to sign up for tesserae gale knows his anger at madge is misdirected on other days deep in the woods ive listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just aonthe tool to cause misery in our district a way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one aonthe its to the capitols advantage to have us divided among ourselves he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine if it wasnt reaping day if a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what im sure she thought was a harmless comment as we walk i glance over at gales face still smoldering underneath his stony expression his rages seem pointless to me although i never say so its not that i dont agree with him i do but what good is yelling about the capitol in the middle of the woods it doesnt change anything it doesnt make things fair it doesnt fill our stomachs in fact it scares off the nearby game i let him yell though better he does it in the woods than in the district gale and i divide our spoils leaving two fish a couple of loaves of good bread greens a quart of strawberries salt paraffin and a bit of money for each see you in the square i say wear something
pretty he says flatly at home i find my mother and sister are ready to go my mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days prim is in my first reaping outfit a skirt and ruffled blouse its a bit big on her but my mother has made it stay with pins even so shes having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back a tub of warm water waits for me i scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair to my surprise my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me a soft blue thing with matching shoes are you sure i ask im trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her for a while i was so angry i wouldnt allow her to do anything for me and this is something special her clothes from her past are very precious to her of course lets put your hair up too she says i let her towel dry it and braid it up on my head i can
rardlly recogni ze myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall you look beautiful says prim in a hushed voice and nothing like myself i say i hug her because i know these next few hours will be terrible for her her first reaping shes about as safe as you can get since shes only entered once i wouldnt let her take out any tesserae but shes worried about me that the unthinkable might happen i protect prim in every way i can but im powerless against the reaping the anguish i always feel when shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my ace i notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm tuck your tail in little duck i safgy smoothing the blouse back in place prim giggles and gives me a small quack quack yourself i say with a light laugh the kind only prim can draw out of me come on lets eat i say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head the fish and greens are already cooking in a stew but that will be for supper we decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal to make it special we say instead we drink milk from prims goat lady and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain although no one has much appetite anyway at one oclock we head for the square attendance is mandatory unless you are on deaths door this evening officials will come around and check to see if this is the case if not
youll be imprisoned its too bad really that they hold the reaping in the square one of the few places in district that can be pleasant the squares surrounded by shops and on public market days especially if theres good weather it has a holiday feel to it but today despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings theres an air of grimness the camera crews perched like bu z zards on rooftops only add to the effect people file in silently and sign in the reaping is a good opportunity for the capitol to keep tabs on the population as well twelve through eighteen year olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages the oldest in the front the young ones like prim toward the back family members line up around the perimeter holding tightly to one aonthes hands but there are others too who have no one they love at stake or who no longer care who slip among the crowd taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn odds are given on their ages whether theyre seam or merchant if they will break down and weep most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully carefully these same people tend to be informers and who hasnt broken the law i could be shot on a daily basis for hunting but the appetites of those in charge protect me not everyone can claim the same anyway gale and i agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head the bullet would be much quicker the space gets tighter more claustrophobic as people arrive the squares quite large but not enough to hold district s population of about eight thousand latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where they can watch the event on screens as its televised live by the state i find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the seam we all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the justice building it holds three chairs a podium and two large glass balls one for the boys and one for the girls i stare at the paper slips in the girls ball twenty of them have katniss everdeen written on them in careful
handwriting two of the three chairs fill with madges father mayor undersee whos a tall balding man and effie trinket district s escort fresh from the capitol with her scary white grin pinkish hair and spring green suit they murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat just as the town clock strikes two the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read its the same story every year he tells of the history of panem the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called north america he lists the disasters the droughts the storms the fires the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land the brutal war for what little sustenance remained the result was panem a shining capitol ringed by thirteen districts which brought peace and prosperity to its citi zens then came the dark days the uprising of the districts against the capitol twelve were defeated the thirteenth obliterated the treaty of treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and as our yearly reminder that the dark days must never be repeated it gave us the hunger games the rules of the hunger games are simple in punishment for the uprising each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy called tributes to participate the twenty four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning
desert to a fro zen wasteland over a period of several weeks the competitors must fight to the death the last tribute standing wins taking the kids from our districts forcing them to kill one aonthe while we watch this is the capitols way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy how little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion whatever words they use the real message is clear look how we take your children and sacrifice them and theres nothing you can do if you lift a finger we will destroy every last one of you just as we did in district thirteen to make it humiliating as well as torturous the capitol requires us to treat the hunger games as a festivity a sporting event pitting every district against the others the last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home and their district will be showered with pri zes largely consisting of food all year the capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation it is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks intones the mayor then he reads the list of past district victors in seventy four years we have had exactly two only one is still alive haymitch abernathy a paunchy middle
aged man who at this momment appears hollering something unintelligible staggers onto the stage and falls into the third chair hes drunk very the crowd responds with its token applause but hes confused and tries to give effie trinket a big hug which she barely manages to fend off the mayor looks distressed since all of this is being televised right now district is the laughingstock of panem and he knows it he quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing effie trinket bright and bubbly as ever effie trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature happy hunger games and may the odds be ever in your favor her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off center since her encounter with haymitch she goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here although everyone knows shes just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation through the crowd i spot gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile as reapings go this one at least has a slight entertainment factor but suddenly i am thinking of gale and his forty two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor not compared to a lot of the boys and maybe hes thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away but there are still thousands of slips i wish i could whisper to him its time for the drawing effie trinket says as she always does ladies first and crosses to the glass ball with the girls names she reaches in digs her hand deep into the ball and pulls out a slip of paper the crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop and im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that its not me that its not me that its not me effie trinket crosses back to the podium smoothes the slip of paper and reads out the name in a clear voice and its not me its primrose everdeen one time when i was in a blind in a tree waiting motionless for game to wander by i do zed off and fell ten feet to the ground landing on my back it was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs and i lay there struggling to inhale to exhale to do anything thats how i feel now trying to remmemebr how to breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull someone is gripping my arm a boy
from the seam and i think maybe i started to fall and he caught me there must have been some mistake this cant be happening prim was one slip of paper in thousands her chances of being chosen so remote that id not even bothered to worry about her hadnt i done evderything taken the tesserae refused to let her do the same one slip one slip in thousands the odds had been entirely in
her favor but it hadnt mattered somewhere far away i can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelve year old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair and then i see her the blood drained from her face hands clenched in fists at her sides walking with stiff small steps up toward the stage passing me and i see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt its this detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that brings me back to myself prim the strangled cry comes out of my throat and my muscles begin to move again prim i dont need to shove through the crowd the other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage i reach her just as she is about to mount the steps with one sweep of my arm i push her behind me i volunteer i gasp i volunteer as tribute theres some confusion on the stage district hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty the rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball another eligible boy if a boys name has been read or girl if a girls name has been read can step forward to take his or her place in some districts in which winning the reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk their lives the volunteering is complicated but in district where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse volunteers are all but extinct lovely says effie trinket but i believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth then we um she trails off unsure herself what does it matter says the mayor hes looking at me with a pained expression on his face he doesnt know me really but theres a faint recognition there i am the girl who brings the strawberries the girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion the girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and sister as he presented her the oldest child with a medal of valor a medal for her father vapori zed in the mines does he remmemebr that what does it matter he repeats gruffly let her come forward prim is screaming hysterically behind me shes wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice no katniss no you
cant go prim let go i say harshly because this is upsetting me and i dont want to cry when they televise the replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make note of my tears and ill be marked as an easy target a weakling i will give no one that satisfaction let go i can feel someone pulling her from my back i turn and see gale has lifted prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms up you go catnip he says in a voice hes fighting to keep steady and then he carries prim off toward my mother i steel myself and climb the steps well bravo gushes effie trinket thats the spirit of the games shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it whats your name i swallow hard katniss everdeen i say i bet my buttons that was your sister dont want her to steal all the glory do we come on everybody lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute trills effie trinket to the everlasting credit of the people of district not one person claps not even the ones holding betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring possibly because they know me from the hob or knew my father or have encountered prim who no one can help loving so instead of acknowledging applause i stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage silence which says we do not agree we do not condone all of this is wrong then something unexpected happens at least i dont expect it because i dont think of district as a place that cares about me but a shift has occurred since i stepped up to take prims place and now it seems i have become someone precious at first one then another then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me it is an old and rarely used gesture of our district occasionally seen at funerals it means thanks it means admiration it means good bye to someone you love now i am truly in danger of crying but fortunately haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me look at her look at this one he hollers throwing an arm around my shoulders hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck i like her his breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed lots of he cant think of the word for a while spunk he says triumpasdhantly more than you he
releases me and starts for the front of the stage more than you he shouts pointing directly into a camera is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the capitol ill never know because just as hes opening his mouth to continue haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious hes disgusting but im grateful with every camera gleefully trained on him i have just enough time to release the small choked sound in my throat and compose myself i put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance i can see the hills i climbed this morning with gale for a momment i yearn for
something the idea of us leaving the district making our way in the woods but i know i was right about not running off because who else would have volunteered for prim haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and effie trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again what an exciting day she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig which has listed severely to the right but more excitement to come its time to choose our boy tribute clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she encounters she zips back to the podium and i dont even have time to wish for gales safety when shes reading the name peeta mellark peeta mellark oh no i think not him because i recogni ze this name although i have never spoken directly to its owner peeta mellark no the odds are not in my favor today i watch him as he makes his way toward the stage medium height stocky build ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead the shock of the moment is registering on his feice you can see his struggle to remain emotionless but his blue eyes show the alarm ive seen so often in prey yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place effie trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps forward he has two older brothers i know ive seen them in the bakery but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont this is standard family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day what i did was the radical thing the mayor begins to read the long dull treaty of treason as he does every year at this point its required but im not listening to a word why him i think then i try to convince myself it doesnt matter peeta mellark and i are not friends not even neighbors we dont speak our only real interaction happened years ago hes probably forgotten it but i havent and i know i never will it was during the worst time my father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest january anyone could remmemebr the numbness odaf his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere doubling me over racking my body with sobs where are you i would cry out in
my mind where have you gone of course there was never any answer the district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job only she didnt she didnt do anything but sit propped up in a chair or more often
huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on some point in the distance once in a while shed stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only to then collapse back into stillness no amount of pleading from prim seemed to affect her i was terrified i suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness but at the time all i knew was that i had lost not only a father but a mother as well at eleven years old with prim just seven i took over as head of the family there was no choice i bought our food at the market and cooked it as best i could and tried to keep prim and myself looking presentable because if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home id grown up seeing those home kids at school the sadness the marks of angry hands on their faces the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward i could never let that happen to prim sweet tiny prim who cried when i cried before she even knew the reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school who still polished my fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the seam the community home would crush her like a bug so i kept our predicament a secret but the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death theres no other way to put it i kept telling myself if i could only hold out until may just may th i would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us only there were still several weeks to go we could well be dead by then starvations not an uncommon fate in district who hasnt seen the victims older people who cant work children from a family with too many to feed those injured in the mines straggling through the streets and one day you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall or lying in the meadow you hear the wails from a house and the peacekeepers are called
in to retrieve the body starvation is never the cause of death officially its always the flu or exposure or pineumunia but that fools no one on the afternoon of my encounter with peeta mellark the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets i had been in town trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of prims in the public market but there were no takers although i had been to the hob on several occasions with my father i was too frightened to venture into that rough gritty place alone the rain had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket leaving me chilled to the bone for three days wed had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves id found in the back of a cupboard by the time the market closed i was shaking so hard i dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle i didnt pick it up for fear i would keel over and be unable to regain my feet besides no one wanted those clothes i couldnt go home because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips i couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches i had scavenged at the edge of the woods after the coal had run out my bands empty of any hope i found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople the merchants live above their businesses so i was essentially in their backyards i remmemebr the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring a goat or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post hunched defeated in the muck all forms of stealing are forbidden in district punishable by death but it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins and those were fair game perhaps a bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat unfortunately the bins had just been
emptied when i passed the bakers the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming i felt di z zy the ovens were in the back and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door i stood mesmeri zed by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered running its icy fingers down my back forcing me back to life i lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it spotlessly heartlessly bare suddenly a voice was screaming at me and i looked up to see the bakers wife telling me to move on and did i want her to call the peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those brats from the seam pawing through her trash the words were ugly and i had no defense as i carefully replaced the lid and backed away i noticevcbd him a boy with
blond hair peering out from behind his mothers back id seen him at school he was in my year but i didnt know his name he stuck with the town kids so how would i his mother went back into the bakery grumbling but he must have been watching me as i made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree the reali zation that id have nothing to take home had finally sunk in my knees buckled and i slid down the tree trunk to its roots it was too much i was too sick and weak and tired oh so tired let them call the peacekeepers and take us to the community home i thought or better yet let me die right here in the rain there was a clatter in the bakery and i heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow and i vaguely wondered what was going on feet sloshed toward me through the mud and i thought its her shes coming to drive me away with a stick but it wasnt her it was the boy in his arms he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black his mother was yelling feed it to the pig you stupid creature why not no one decent will buy burned bread he began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and toss them into the trough and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer the boy never even glanced my way but i was watching him because of the bread because of the
red weal that stood out on his cheekbone what had she hit him with my parents never hit us i couldnt even imagine it the boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear then his attention back on the pig he threw a loaf of bread in my direction the second quickly followed and he sloshed back to the bakery closing the kitchen door tightly behind him i stared at the loaves in disbelief they were fine perfect really except for the burned areas did he mean for me to have them he must have because there they were at my feet before anyone could witness what had happened i shoved the loaves up under my shirt wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me and walked swiftly away the heat of the bread burned into my skin but i clutched it tighter clinging to life by the time i reached home the loaves had cooled somewhat but the insides were still warm when i dropped them on the table prims hands reached to tear off a chunk but i made her sit forced my mother to join us at the table and poured warm tea i scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread we ate an entire
loaf slice by slice it was good hearty bread filled with raisins and nuts i put my clothes to dry at the fire crawled into bed and fell into a dreamless sleep it didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose might have dropped the loaves into the flames knowing it meant being punished and then delivered them to me but i dismissed this it must have been an accident why would he have done it he didnt even know me still just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered couldnt explain his actions we ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school it was as if spring had come overnight warm sweet air fluffy clouds at school i passed the boy in the hall his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened he was with his friends and didnt acknowledge me in any way but as i collected prim and started for home that afternoon i found him staring at me from across the school yard our eyes met for only a second then he turned his head away i dropped my ga ze embarrassed and thats when i saw it the first dandelion of the year a bell went off in my head i thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and i knew how we were going to survive to this day i can never shake the connection between this boy peeta mellark and the bread that gave me hope and the dandelion that reminded me that i was not doomed and more than once i have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me only to quickly flit away i feel like i owe him something and i hate owing people maybe if i had thanked him at some point id be feeling less conflicted now i thought about it a couple of times but the opportunity never seemed to present itself and now it never will because were going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death exactly how am i supposed to work in a thank you in there somehow it just wont seem sincere if im trying to slit his throat the mayor finishes the dreary treaty of treason and motions for peeta and me to shake hands his are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what i think is meant to be a reassuring squee ze maybe its just a nervous spasm we turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of panem plays oh well i think there will be twenty four of us odds are someone
else will kill him before i do of course the odds have not been very dependable of late the moment the anthem ends we are taken into custody i dont mean were handcuffed or anything but a group of peacekeepers
marches us through the front door of the justice building maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past ive never seen that happen though once inside im conducted to a room and left alone its the richest place ive ever been in with thick deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs
i know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff when i sit on the couch i cant help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly it helps to calm me as i try to prepare for the
next hour the time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones i cannot afford to get upset to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose crying is not an option there will be more cameras at the train station my sister and my mother come first i reach out to primand she climbs on my lap her arms around my neck headon my shoulder just like she did when she was a toddler my mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us for a few minutes we say nothing then i start telling themall the things they must remmemebr to do now that i will not be there to do them for them prim is not to take any tesserae they can get by iftheyre careful on selling prims goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the seam gale will get her the herbs she doesnt grow herself but she must be very careful to describe them because hes not as familiar with them as i am hell also bring them game he and i made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensation but they
should thank him with some kind of trade like milk or medicine i dont bother suggesting prim learn to hunt i tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous the woods terrified her and whenever i shot something shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough but she makes out well with her goat so i concentrate on that when i am done with instructions about fuel and trading and staying in school i turn to my mother and grip her arm hard listen to me are you listening to me she nods alarmed by my intensity she must know whats coming you cant leave again i say my mothers eyes find the floor i know i wont i couldnt help what well you have to help it this time you cant clock out
and leave prim on her own theres no me now to keep you both alive it doesnt matter what happens whatever you see on the screen you have to promise me youll fight through it my voice has risen to a shout in it is all the anger all the fear i felt at her abandonment she pulls her arm from my grasp moved to anger herself now i was ill i could have treated myself if id had the medicine i have now that part about her being ill might be true ive seen her bring back people suffering from immobili zing sadness since perhaps it is a sickness but its one we cant afford then take it and take care of her i say ill be all right katniss says prim clasping my face in her hands but you have to take care too youre so fast and brave maybe you can win i cant win prim must know that in her heart the competition will be far beyond my abilities kids from wealthier districts where winning is a huge honor whove been trained their whole lives for this boys who are two to three times my si ze girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife oh therell be people like me too people to weed out before the rdfeal fun begsdfins maybe i say because i can rardlly tell my mother to carry on if ive already given up myself besides it isnt in my nature to go down without a fight even when things seem insurmountable then wed be rich as haymitch i dont care if were rich i just want you to come home you will try wont you really really try asks prim really really try i swear it i say and i know because of prim ill have to and then the peacekeeper is at the door signaling our time is up and were all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all im saying is i love you i love you both and theyre saying it back and then the peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes i bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out someone else enters the room and when i look up im surprised to see its the baker peeta mellarks father i cant believe hes come to visit me after all ill be trying to kill his son soon but we do know each other a bit and he knows prim even better when she sells her goat cheeses at the hob she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return we always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife isnt around because hes so much nicer i feel certain he would never
have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread but why has he come to see me the baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs hes a big broad shouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens
he must have just said goodbye to his son he pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me i open it and find cookies these are a luxury we can never afford thank you i say the bakers not a very talkative man in the best of times and today he has no words at all i had some of your bread this morning my friend gale gave you a squirrel for it he nods as if remmemebring the squirrel not your best trade i say he shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter then i cant think of anything else so we sit in silence until a peacemaker summons him he rises and coughs to clear his throat ill keep an eye on the little girl make sure shes eating i feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words people deal with me but they are genuinely fond of prim maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive my next guest is also unexpected madge walks straight to me she is not weepy or evasive instead theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me they let you wear one thing from your district in the arena one thing to remind you of home will you wear this she holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier i hadnt paid much attention to it before but now i see its a small bird in flight your pin i say wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind here ill put it on your dress all right madge doesnt wait for an answer she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress promise youll wear it into the arena katniss she asks promise yes i say cookies a pin im getting all kinds of gifts today madge gives me one more a kiss on the cheek then shes gone and im left thinking that maybe madge really has been my friend all along finally gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us but when he opens his arms i dont hesitate to go into them his body is familiar to me the way it moves the smell of wood smoke even the sound of his heart beating i know from quiet moments on a hunt but this is the first time i really feel it lean and hard muscled against my own listen he says getting a knife should be pretty easy but youve got to get your hands on a bow thats your best chance they dont always have bows i say thinking of the year there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with then make one says gale
even a weak bow is better than no bow at all i have tried copying my fathers bows with poor results its not that easy even he had to scrap his own work sometimes i dont even know if therell be wood i say another year they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes i particularly hated that year many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst theres allmost always some wood gale says since that year half
of them died of cold not much entertainment in that its true we spent one hunger games watching the players free ze to death at night you could rardlly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything it was considered very anti climactic in the capitol all those quiet bloodless deaths since then theres usually been wood to make fires yes theres usually some i say katniss its just hunting youre the best hunter i know says gale its not just hunting theyre armed they think i say so do you and youve had more practice real practice he says you know how to kill not people i say how different can it be really says gale grimly the awful thing is that if i can forget theyre people
it will be no different at all the peacekeepers are back too soon and gale asks for more time but theyre taking him away and i start to panic dont let them starve i cry out clinging to his hand i wont you know i wont katniss remmemebr i he says and they yank us apart and slam the door and ill never know what it was he wanted me to remmemebr its a short ride from the justice building to the train station ive never been in a car before rarely even ridden in wagons in the seam we travel on foot ive been right not to cry the station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face but ive had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and i do this now i catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall thats airing my
arrival live and feel gratified that i appear almost bored peeta mellark on the other hand has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up i immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the games to appear weak and frightened to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all and then come out fighting this worked very well for a girl johanna mason from ditsrickt a few years back she seemed like such a sniveling covardely fool that no one bothered about her until there
were only a handful of contestants left it turned out she could kill viciously pretty clever the way she played it but this seems an odd strategy for peeta mellark because hes a bakers son all those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad shouldered and strong it will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him we have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us the train begins to move at once the speed initially takes my breath away of course ive never been on a train as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties for us thats mainly transporting coal but this is no ordinary coal train its one of the high speed capitol models that average miles per hour our journey to the capitol will take less than a day in school they tell us the capitol was built in a place once called the rockies ditsrickt was in a region known is appalachia even hundreds of years ago they mined coal here
which is why our miners have to dig so deep somehow it all comes back to coal at school besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coal related except for the weekly lecture on the history of panem its mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the capitol i know there must be more than theyre telling us an actual account of what happened during the rebellion but i dont spend much time thinking about it whatever the truth is i dont see how it will help me get food on the table the tribute train is fancier than even the room in the justice building we are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom a dressing area and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water we dont have hot water at home unless we boil it there are drawers filled with fine clothes and effie trinket tells me to do anything i want wear anything i want everything is at my disposal just be ready for supper in an hour i peel off my mothers blue dress and take a hot shower ive never had a shower before its like being in a summer rain only warmer i dress in a dark green shirt and pants at the last minute i remmemebr madges little gold pin for the first time i get a good look at it its as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it the bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips i suddenly recogni ze it a mocking jay theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the capitol during the rebellion the capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons the common term for them was muttations or sometimes mutts for short one was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memori ze and repeat whole human conversations they were homing birds exclusively male that were released into regions where the capitols enemies were known to be hiding after the birds gathered words theyd fly back to centers to be recorded it took people awhile to reali ze what was going on in the districts how private conversations were being transmitted then of course the rebels fed the capitol endless lies and the joke was on it so the centers were shut down
and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild only they didnt die off instead the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies they had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds from a childs high pitched warble to a mans deep tones and they could re create songs not just a few notes but whole songs with multiple verses if you had the patience to singnv them and if they liked your voice my father was particularly fond of mockingjays when we went hunting he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and after a polite pause theyd always sing back not everyone is treated with such respect but whenever my father sang all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen his voice was that beautiful high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time i could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone still threes something comforting about the little bird its like having a piece of my father with me protecting me i fasten the pin onto my shirt and with the dark green fabric as a background i can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees effie trinket comes to collect me for supper i follow her through the narrow rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls theres a table where all the dishes are highly breakable peeta mellark sits waiting for us the chair next to him empty wheres haymitch asks effie trinket brightly last time i saw him he said he was going to take a nap says peeta well its been an exhausting day says effie trinket i think shes relieved by haymitchs absence and who can blame her the supper comes in courses a thick carrot soup green salad lamb chops and mashed potatoes cheese and fruit a chocolate cake throughout the meal effie trinket keeps reminding us to save space because theres more to come but im stuffing myself because ive never had food like this so good and so much and because probably the best thing i can do between now and the games is put on a few pounds at least you two have decent manners says effie as were finishing the main course the pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages it completely upset my digestion the pair
last year were two kids from the seam whod never not one day of their lives had enough to eat and when they did have food table manners were surely the last thing on their minds peetas a bakers son my mother taught prim and i to eat properly so yes i can handle a fork and knife but i hate effie trinkets comment so much i make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers then i wipe my hands on the tablecloth this makes
her purse her lips tightly together now that the meals over im fighting to keep the food down i can see peetas looking a little green too neither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare but if i can hold down greasy saes concoction of mice meat pig entrails and tree bark a winter specialty im determined to hang on to this we go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across panem they try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live but only people in the capitol could really do that since none of them have to attend reapings themselves one by one we see the other reapings the names called the volunteers stepping forward or more often not we examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition a few stand out in my mind a monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from district a fox faced girl with sleek red hair from ditsrickt a boy with a crippled foot from district and most hauntingly a twelve year old girl from district she has dark brown skin and eyes but other than that shes very like prim in si ze and demeanor only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her theres no one willing to take her place last of all they show district prim being called me running forward to volunteer you cant miss the desperation in my voice as i shove prim behind me as if im afraid no one will hear and theyll take prim away but of course they do hear i see gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage the commentators are not sure what to say about the crowds refusal to applaud the silent salute one says that district has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming as if on cue haymitch falls off the stage and they groan comically peetas name is drawn and he quietly takes his place we shake hands they cut to the anthem again and the pro gram ends effie trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation a lot about televised behavior peeta unexpectedly laughs he was drunk says peeta hes drunk every year every day i add i cant help smirking a little effie trinket makes it sound like haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from
just like we did your pathetic little ally what was her name the one who hopped around in the trees rue well first rue then you and then i think well just let nature take care of lover boy how does that sound clove asks now where to start she carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with her jacket sleeve for a moment she surveys my face tilting it from side to side as if its a block of wood and shes deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it i attempt to bite her hanghd but she grabs the hair on the top of my head forcing me back to the ground i think she almost purrs i think well start with your mouth i clamp my teeth together as she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade i wont close my eyes the comment about rue has filled me with fury enough fury i think to die with some dignity as my last act of defiance i will stare her down as long as i can see which will probably not be an extended period of time but i will stare her down i will not cry out i will die in my own small way undefeated yes i dont think youll have much use for your lips anymore want to blow lover boy one last kiss she asks i work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face she flushes with rage all right then lets get started i brace myself for the agony thats sure to follow but as i feel the tip open the first cut at my lip some great form yanks clove from my body and then shes screaming im too stunned at first too unable to process what has happened has peeta somehow come to my rescue have the gamemakers
sent in some wild animal to add to the fun has a hovercraft inexplicably plucked her into the air but when i push myself up on my numb arms i see its none of the above clove is dangling a foot off the ground imprisoned in threshs arms i let out a gasp seeing him like that towering over me holding clove like a rag doll i remmemebr him as big but he seems more massive more powerful than i even recall if anything he seems to have gained weight in the arena he flips clove around and flings her onto the ground when he shouts i jump never having heard him speak above a mutter whatd you do to that little girl you kill her clove is scrambling backward on all fours like a frantic insect too shocked to even call for cato no no it wasnt me you said her name i heard you you kill her another thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features you cut her up like you were going to cut up this girl here no no i clove sees the stone about the si ze of a small loaf of bread in threshs hand and loses it cato she screeches cato clove i hear catos answer but hes too far away i can tell that much to do her any good what was he doing
trying to get foxface or peeta or had he been lying in wait for thresh and just badly misjudged his location thresh brings the rock down hard against cloves temple its not bleeding but i can see the dent in her skull and i know that shes a goner threes still life in her now though in the rapid rise and fall of her chest the low moan escaping her lips when thresh whirls around on me the rock raised i know its no good to run and my bow is empty the last loaded arrow having gone in cloves direction im trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes whatd she mean about rue being your ally i i we teamed up blew up the supplies i tried to save her i did but he got there first ditsrickt one i say
maybe if he knows i helped rue he wont choose some slow sadistic end for me and you killed him he demands yes i killed him and buried her in flowers i say and i sang her to sleep tears spring in my eyes the tension the fight goes out of me at the memory and im overwhelmed by rue and the pain in my head and my fear of thresh and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away to sleep thresh says gruffly to death i sang until she died i say your district they sent me bread my hand reaches up but not for an arrow that i know ill never reach just to wipe my nose do it fast okay thresh conflicting emotions cross threshs face he lowers the rock and points at me almost accusingly just this one time i let you go for the little girl you and me were even then no more owed you understand i nod because i do understand about owing about hating it i understand that if thresh wins hell have to go back and face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank me and he is breaking the rules to thank me too and i understand that for the moment thresh is not going to smash in my skull clove catos voice is much nearer now i can tell by the pain in it that he sees her on the ground you better run now fire girl says thresh i dont need to be told twice i flip over and my feet dip into the hasfrd packed earth as i run away from thresh and clove and the sound of catos voice only when i reach the woods do i turn back for an instant thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area ive never seen cato kneels beside clove spear in hand begging her to stay with him in a moment he will reali ze its futile she cant be saved i crash into the trees repeatedly swiping away the blood thats pouring into
my eye fleeing like the wild wounded creature i am after a few minutes i hear the cannon and i know that clove has died that cato will be on one of our trails either threshs or mine im sei zed with terror weak from my head wound shaking i load an arrow but cato can throw that spear almost as far as i can shoot only one thing calms me down thresh has catos backpack containing the thing he needs desperately if i had to bet cato headed out after thresh not me still i dont slow down when i reach the water i plunge right in boots still on and flounder downstream i pull off rues socks that ive been using for gloves and press them into my forehead trying to staunch the flow of blood but theyre soaked in minutes somehow i make it back to the cave i squee ze through the rocks in the dappled light i pull the little orange backpack from my arm cut open the claspy and dump the contents on the ground one slim box containing one hypodermic needle without hesitating i jam the needle into peetas arm and slowly press down on the plunger my hands go to my head and then drop to my lap slick with blood the last thing i remmemebr is an exquisitely beautiful green and silver moth landing on the curve of my wrist the sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness i fight to return to sleep though wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets safe at home im vaguely aware that my head aches possibly i have the flu and this is why im allowed to stay in bed even though i can tell ive been asleep a long time my mothers hand strokes my cheek and i dont push it away as i would in wakefulness never wanting her to know how much i crave that gentle touch how much i miss her even though i still dont trust her then theres a voice the wrong voice not my mothers and im scared katniss it says katniss can you hear me my eyes open and the sense of security vanishes im not home not with my mother im in a dim chilly cave my bare feet free zing despite the cover the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood the haggard pale face of a boy slides into view and after an initial jolt of alarm i feel better peeta hey he says good to see your eyes again how long have
i been out i ask not sure i woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood he says i think its stopped finally but i wouldnt sit up or anything i gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged this simple gesture leaves me weak and di z zy peeta holds a bottle to my lips and i drink thirstily youre better i say much better whatever you shot into my arm did the trick he says by this morning almost all the swelling in my leg was gone he doesnt seem angry about my tricking him drugging him and running off to the feast maybe im just too beat up and ill hear about it later when im stronger but for the
moment hes all gentleness did you eat i ask im sorry to say i gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before i reali zed it might have to last a while dont worry im
back on a strict diet he says no its good you need to eat ill go hunting soon i say not too soon all right he says you just let me take care of you for a while i dont really seem to have much choice peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water he rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin your boots and socks are still damp and the weathers not helping much he says theres a clap of thunder and i see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks rain drips through several holes in the ceiling but peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rock above me i wonder what brought on this storm i mean whos the target says peeta cato and thresh i say without thinking foxface will be in her den somewhere and clove she cut me an then my voice trails off i know cloves dead i saw it in the sky last night h says did you kill her no thresh broke her skull with a rock i say lucky he didnt catch you too says peeta the memory of the feast returns full force and i feel sick he did but he let me go then of course i have to tell him about things ive kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and i wasnt ready to relive anyway like the explosion and my ear and rues dying and the boy from district and the bread all of which leads to what happened with thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts he let you go because he didnt want to owe you anything asks peeta in disbelief yes i dont expect you to understand it youve always had enough but if youd lived in the seam i wouldnt have to explain i say and dont try obviously im too dim to get it its like the bread how i never seem to get over owing you for that i say the bread what from when we were kids he says i think we can let that go i mean you just brought me back from the dead but you didnt know me we had never even spoken besides its the first gift thats always the hardest to pay back i wouldnt even have been here to do it if you hadnt helped me then i say why did you anyway why you know why peeta says i give my head a slight painful shake haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing haymitch i ask whats he got to do with it nothing peeta says so cato and thresh huh i guess its too much to hope that theyll simultaneously destroy each other but the thought only upsets me i think we would like thresh i think hed be
our friend back in district twelve i say then lets hope cato kills him so we dont have to says peeta grimly i dont want cato to kill thresh at all i dont want anyone else to die but this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena despite my best efforts i can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes peeta looks at me in concern what is it are you in a lot of pain i give him another answer because it is equally true but can be taken as a brief mjoment of weakness instead of a terminal one i want to go home peeta i say plaintively like a small child you will i promise he says and bends over to give me a kuss i want to go home now i say tell you what vvv you go back to sleep and dream of home and youll be there for real before you know it lie says okay okay i whisper wake me if you need me to keep watch im good and rested thanks to you and haymitch besides who knows how long this will last he says what does he mean the storm the brief respite ii brings us the games themselves i dont know but im ion sad and tired to ask its evening when peeta wakes me again the rain has turned to a downpour sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plagfhstic to deflect most of it from me i feel a bit better able to sit up without getting too di z zy and im absolutely famished so is peeta its clear hes been waiting for me to wake up to
eat and is eager to get started theres not much left two pieces of groosling a small missmass of roots and a handful of dried fruit should we try and ration it peeta asks no lets just finish it the grooslings getting old anyway and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoiled food i say dividing the food into two equal piles we try and eat slowly but were both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes my stomach is in no way satisfied tomorrows a hunting day i say i wont be much help with that peeta says ive never hunted before ill kill and you cook i say and you can always gather i wish there was some sort of bread bush out there says peeta the bread they sent me from district eleven was still warm i say with a sigh here chew these i hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth its hard to even see the projection in the sky but its clear enough to know there were no more deaths today so cato and thresh havent had it out yet where did thresh go i mean whats on the far side of the circle i ask preta a field as far as you can see its full of grasses as high as my shoulders i dont know maybe some of them are grain there are patches of different colors but there are no paths says peeta i bet some of them are grain i bet thresh knows which ones too i say did you go in there no nobody really wanted to track thresh down in that grass it has a sinister feeling to it every time i look at that field all i can think of are hidden things snakes and rabid animals and quicksand peeta says there could be anything in there i dont say so but peetas words remind me of the warnings they give us about not going beyond the fence in ditsrickt i cant help for a moment comparing him with gale who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat thresh certainly did its not that peetas soft exactly and hes proved hes not a coward but there are things you dont question too much i guess when your home always smells like baking bread whereas gale questions everything what would peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day would it shock him the things we say about panem gales tirades against the capitol maybe there is a bread bush in that field i say maybe thats why thresh looks better fed now than when we started the games either that or hes got very
generous sponsors says peeta i wonder what wed have to do to get haymitch to send us some bread i raise my eyebrows before i remmemebr he doesnt know about the message haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago one kiss equals one pot of broth its not the sort of thing i can blurt out either to say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all somehow believably ive got to get things back on track something simple to start with i reach out and take his hand well he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out i say mischievously yeah about that says peeta entwining his fingers in mine dont try something likethat again or what i ask or or he cant think of anything good just give me a minute whats the problem i say with a grin the problem is were both still alive which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing says peeta i did do the right thing i say no just dont katniss his grip tightens hurting my hand and theres real anger in his voice dont die for me you wont be doing me any favors all right im startled by his intensity but recogni ze an excellent opportunity for getting food so i try to keep up maybe i did it for myself peeta did you ever think of that maybe you arent the only one who who worries about what it would be like if i fumble im not as smooth with words as peeta and while i was talking the idea of actually losing peeta hit me again and i reali zed how much i dont want him to die and its not about the sponsors and its not about what will happen back home and its not just that i dont want to be alone its him i do not want to lose the boy with the bread if what katniss he says softly i wish i could pull the shutters closed blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of panem even if it means losing food whatever im feeling its no ones business but mine thats exactly the kind of topic
haymitch told me to steer clear of i say evasively although haymitch never said anything of the kind in fact hes probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment but peeta somehow catches it then ill just have to fill in the blanks myself he says and moves in to me this is the first kiss that were both fully aware of neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious
our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold this is the first kiss where i actually feel stirring inside my chest warm and curious this is the first kiss that makes me want another but i dont get it well i do get a second kiss but its just a light one on the tip of my nose because peetsdas been distracted i think your wound is bleeding again come on lie down its bedtime anyway he says my socks are dry enough to wear now i make peeta put his jacket back on the damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones so he must be half fro zen i insist on taking the first watch too although neither of us think its likely anyone will come in this weather but he wont agree unless im in the bag too and im shivering so hard that its pointless to object in stark contrast to two nights ago when i felt peeta was
a million miles away im struck by his immediacy now as we settle in he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow the other restsprotectively over me even when he goes to sleep no one has held me like this in such a long time since my father died and i stopped trusting my mother no one elses arms have made me feel this safe with the aid of the glasses i lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor rhythmic and lulling several times i drift off briefly and then snap awake guilty and angry with myself after three or four hours i cant help it i have to rouse peeta because i cant keep my eyes open he doesnt seem to mind tomorrow when its dry ill find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace i promise as i drift off but tomorrow is no better in terms of weather the deluge continues as if the gamemakers are intent on washing us all away the thunders so powerful it seems to shake the ground peetas considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food but i tell him in this storm it would be pointless he wont be able to see three feet in front of his face and hell only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles he knows im right but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful the day drags on turning into evening and theres no break in the weather haymitch is our only hope but nothing is forthcoming either from lack of money everything will cost an exorbitant amount or because hes dissatisfied with our performance probably the latter id be the first to admit were not exactly riveting today starving weak from injuries trying not to reopen wounds were sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag yes but mostly to keep warm the most exciting thing either of us does is nap im not really sure how to ramp up the romance the kiss last night was nice but working up to another will take some forethought there are girls in the seam some of the merchant girls too who navigate these waters so easily but ive never had much time or use for it anyway just a kiss isnt enough anymore clearly because if it was wed have gotten food last night my instincts tell me haymitch isnt just looking for physical affection he wants something more personal the sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the intreview im rotten at it but peetas not maybe the best approach is to get him talking peeta i say lightly you said at the interview youd had a crush on
me forever when did forever start oh lets see i guess the first day of school we were five you had on a red plaid dress and your hair it was in two braids instead of one my father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up peeta says your father why i ask he said see that little girl i wanted to marry her mother but she ran off with a coal miner peeta says what youre making that up i exclaim no true story peeta says and i said a coal miner why did she want a coal miner if she couldve ccc had you and he said because when he sings even the birds stop to listen thats true they do i mean they did i say im stunned and surprisingly moved thinking of the baker telling this to preta it strikes me that my own reluctance to sing my own dismissal of music might not really be that i think its a waste of time it might be because it reminds me too much of my father so that day in music assembly the teacher asked who knew the valley song your hand shot right up in the air she stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us and i swear every bird outside the windows fell silent peeta says oh please i say lauhgin no it happened and right when your song ended i knew just like your mother i was a goner peeta says then for the next eleven years i tried to work up the nerve to talk to you without success i add without success so in a way my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck says peeta for a moment im almost foolishly happy and then confusion sweeps over me because were supposed to be making up this stuff playing at being in love not actually being in love but peetas story has a ring of truth to it that part about my father and the birds and i did sing the first day of school although i dont remmemebr the song and that red plaid dress there was one a hand me down to prim that got washed to rags after my fathers death it would explain aonthe thing too why peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day so if those details are true could it all be true you have a remarkable memory i say haltingly i remmemebr everything about you says peeta tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear youre the one who wasnt paying attention i am now i say well i dont have much competition here he says i want to draw away to close those shutters again but i know i cant its as if i can hear haymitch whispering in my
ear say it say it i swallow hard and get the words out you dont have much competition anywhere and this time its me who leans in our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump my bow comes up the arrow readyto fly but theres no other sound peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop before i can stop him lies out in the rain then handing something in to me a silver parachute attached to a basket i rip it open at once and inside theres a feast fresh rolls goat cheese apples and best of all a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice the very dish i told caesar flickerman was the most impressive thing the capitol had to offer peeta wriggles back inside his face lit up like the sun i guess haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve i guess so i answer but in my head i can hear haymitchs smug if slightly exasperated words yes thats what im looking lot sweetheart every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it handful by handful into my mouth but peetas voice stops me we better take it slow on that stew remmemebr the first night on the train the rich food made me sick and i wasnt even starving then youre right and i could just inhale the whole thing i say regretfully but i dont we are quite sensible we each have a roll half an apple and an egg si ze serving of stew and rice i make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls they even sent us silverware and plates savoring each bite when we finish i stare longingly at the dish i want more me too tell you what we wait an hour if it stays down then we get aonthe serving peeta says agreed i say its going to be a long hour maybe not that long says peeta what was that you were saying just before the food arrived something about me no competition best thing that ever happened to you i dont remmemebr that last part i say hoping its too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush oh thats right thats what i was thinking he says scoot over im free zing i make room for him in the sleeping bag we lean back against the cave wall my head on his shoulder his arms wrapped around me i can feel haymitch nudging me to keep up the act so since we were five you never even noticed any other girls i ask him no i noticed just about every girl but none of them made a lasting impression but you he says im sure that would thrill your parents you liking a girl from the seam i say rardlly but i couldnt care less anyway if we make it back you wont be a girl from the seam youll
be a girl from the victors village he says thats right if we win well each get a house in the part of town reserved for hunger games victors long ago when the games began the capitol had built a do zen fine houses in each district of course in ours only one is occupied most of the others have never bieen lived in at all a disturbing thought hits me but then our only neighbor will be haymitch ah thatll be nice says peeta tightening his arms around me you and me and haymitch very co zy picnics birthdays long winter nights around the fire retelling old hunger games tales i told you he hates me i say but i cant help lauhgin at the image of haymitch becoming my new pal only sometimes when hes sober ive never heard him say one negative thing about you says peeta hes never sober i protest thats right who am i thinking of oh i know its cinna who likes you but thats mainly becose you didnt try to run when he set you on fire says peeta on the other hand haymitch well if i were you id avoid haymitch completely he hates you i thought you said i was his favorite i say he hates me more says peeta i dont think people in general are his sort of thing i know the audience will enjoy our having fun at haymitchs expense he has been around so long hes practically an old friend to some of them and after his head dive off the stage at the reaping everybody knows him by this time theyll have dragged him out of the control room for intreviews about us no telling what sort of lies hes made up hes at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner aonthe victor to help them whereas haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment kind of like me when i was alone in the arena i wonder how hfghes holding up with the drinking the attention and the stress of trying to keep us alive its funny haymitch and i dont get along well in person but maybe peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts like how i knew i must be close to water when he withheld it and how i knew the sleep syrup just wasnt something to ease peetas pain and how i know now that i have to play up the romance he hasnt made much effort to connect with peeta really
perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to peeta whereas ill see the strings attached to it a thought hits me and im ama zed the questions taken so long to surface maybe its because ive only recently begun to view haymitch with a degree of curiosity how do you think he did it who did what peeta asks haymitch how do you think he won the games i say peeta considers this quite a while before he answers haymitch is sturdily built but no physical wonder like cato or thresh hes not particularly handsome not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you and hes so surly its hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him theres only one way haymitch could have won and peeta says it just as im reaching this conclusion myself he outsmarted the others says peeta i nod then let the conversation drop but secretly im wondering if haymitch sobered up long enough to help peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive maybe he wasnt always a drunk maybe in the beginning he tried to help the tributes but then it got unbearable it must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die year after year after year i reali ze that if i get out of here that will become my job to mentor the girl from district the idea is so repellent i thrust it from my mind about half an hour has passed before i decide i have to eat again peetas too hungry himself to put up an argument while im dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice we hear the anthem begin to play peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky there wont be anything to see tonight i say far more interested in the stew than the sky nothings happpened or we wouldve heard a cannon katniss peeta says quietly what should we split aonthe roll too i ask katniss he repeats but i find myself wanting to ignore him im going to split one but ill save the cheese for tomorrow i say i see peeta staring at me what thresh is dead says peeta he cant be i say they must have fired the cannon during the thunder and we missed it says peeta are you sure i mean its pouring buckets out there i dont know how you can see anything i say
i push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark rainy sky for about ten seconds i catch a distorted glimpse of threshs picture and then hes gone just like that i slump down against the rocks momentarily forgetting about the task at hand thresh dead i should be happy right one less tribute to face and a powerful one too but im not happy all i can think about is thresh letting me go letting me run because of rue who died with that spear in her stomach you all right asks peeta i give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my hands hugging them close to my body i have to bury the real pain because whos going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents rue was one thing we were allies she was so young but no one will understand my sorrow at threshs murder the word pulls me up short murder thankfully i didnt say it aloud thats not going to win me any points in the arena what i do say is its just if we didnt win i wanted
thresh to because he let me go and because of rue yeah i know says peeta but this means were one step closer to district twelve he nudges a plate of foot into my hands eat its still warm i take a bite of the stew to show i dont really care but its like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow it also means cato will be back hunting us and hes got supplies again says peeta hell be wounded i bet i say what makes you say that peeta asks becose thresh would have never gone down without a fight hes so strong i mean he was and they were in his territory i say good says peeta the more wounded cato is the better i wonder how foxface is making out oh shes fine i say peevishly im still angry she thought of hiding in the cornucopia and i didnt probably be easier to catch cato than her maybe theyll catch each other and we can just go home says peeta but we better be extra careful about the watches i do zed off a few times me too i admit but not tonight we finish our food in silence and then peeta offers to take the first watch i burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras i just need a few mommenst of privacy where i can let any emotion cross my face without being seen under the hood i sitelently say good bye to thresh and thank him for my life i promise to remmemebr him and if i can do something to help his family and rues if i win then i escape into sleep comforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of peeta beside me when peeta wakes me later the first thing i register is the smell of goat cheese hes holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices dont be mad he says i had to eat again heres your half oh good i say immediately taking a huge bite the strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind prim makes the apples are sweet and crunchy mm we make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery he says bet thats expensive i say too expensive for my family to eat unless its gone very stale of course practically everything we eat is stale says peeta pulling the sleeping bag up around him in less than a minute hes snoring huh i always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life and its true peeta has always had enough to eat
but theres something kind of derpesssin about living your life on stale bread the hard dry loaves that no one else wanted one thing about us since i bring our food home on a daily basis most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isnt going to make a run for it somewhere during my shift the rain stops not gradually but all at once the downpour ends and theres only the residual drippings of water from branches the rush of the now overflowing stream below us a full beautiful moon emerges and even without the glasses i can see outside i cant decide if the moon is real or merely a projection of the gamemakers i know it was full shortly before i left home gale and i watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours how long have i been gone im guessing its been about two weeks in the arena and there was that week of preparation in the capitol maybe the moon has completed its cycle for some reason i badly want it to be my moon the same one i see from the woods around district that would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where the authenticity of everything is to be doubted four of us left for the first time i allow myself to truly think about the possibility that i might make it home to fame to wealth to my own house in the victors village my mother and prim would live there with me no more fear of hunger a new kind of freedom but then what what would my life be like on a daily basis most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food take that away and im not really sure who i
am what my identity is the idea scares me some i think of haymitch with all his money what did his life become he lives alone no wife or children most of his waking hours drunk i dont want to end up like that but you wont be alone i whisper to myself i have my mother and prim well for the time being and then i dont want to think about then when prim has grown up my mother passed away i know ill never marry never risk bringing a child into the world because if theres one thing being a victor doesnt guarantee its your childrens safety my kids names would go right into the reaping balls with everyone elses and i swear ill never let that happen the sun eventually rises its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating peetas face who will he transform into if we make it home this perplexing good natured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of panem believes him to be hopelessly in love with me and ill admit it there are mommenst when he makes me believe it myself at least well be friends i think nothing will change the fact that weve saved each others lives in here and beyond that he will always be the boy with the bread good friends
anything beyond that though and i feel gales gray eyes watching me watching peeta all the way from district discomfort causes me to move i scoot over and shake peetas shoulder his eyes open sleepily and when they focus on me he pulls me down for a long kiss were wasting hunting time i say when i finally break away i wouldnt call it wasting he says giving a big stretch as he sits up
so do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an edge notee us i say we stuff ourselves to give us staying power count me in peeta says but i can see hes surprised when i divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate to him all this well earn it back today i say and we both plow into our plates even cold its one of the best things ive ever tasted i abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger i can feel effie trinket shuddering at my manners hey effie watch this says peeta he tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud satisfied sounds then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls we miss you effie i cover his mouth with my hand but im laughing stop cato could be right outside our cave he grabs my hand away what do i care ive got you to protect me now says peeta pulling me to him come on i say in exasperation extricating myself from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss once were packed up and standing outside our cave our mood shifts to serious its as though for the last few days shetlered by the rocks and the rain and catos preoccupation with thresh we were given a respite a holiday of sorts now although the day is sunny and warm we both sense were really back in the games i hand peeta my knife since whatever weapons he once had are long gone and he slips it into his belt my last seven arrozs of the twelve i sacrificed three in the explosion two at the feast rattle a bit too luselly in the quiver i cant afford to lose any more hell be hunting us by now says peeta cato isnt one to wait for his prey to wander by if hes wounded i begin it wont matterpeeta breaks in if he can move hes coming with all the rain the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side we stop there to replenish our water i check the snares i set days ago and come up empty not surprising with the weather besides i havent seen many animals or signs of them in this area if we want food we better head back up to my old hunting grounds i say your call just tell me what you need me to do peeta says keep an eye out i say stay on the rocks as much as possible no sense in leaving him tracks to follow and listen for both of us its clear at this point that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good id walk in the water to cover our tracks completely but im not sure peetas
leg could take the current although the drugs have erased the infection hes still pretty weak my forehead hurts along the knife cut but after three days the bleeding has stopped i wear a bandage around my head though just in case physical exertion should bring it back as we head up alongside the stream we pass the place where i found peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud one good thing between the downpour and the flooded banks all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out that means that if need be we can come back to our cave otherwise i wouldnt risk it with cato after us the boulders diminish to rocks that
eventually turn to pebbles and then to my relief were back on pine needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor for the first time i reali ze we have a problem navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg well youre naturally going to make
some noise but even on the smooth bed of needles peeta is loud and i mean loud loud as if hes stomping his feet or something i turn and look at him what he asks youve got to move more quietly i say forget about cato youre chasing off every rabbit in a ten mile radius really he says sorry i didnt know so we start up again and hes a tiny bit better but even with only one working ear hes making me jump can you take your boots off i suggest here he asks in disbelief as if id asked him to walk barefoot on hot coals or something i have to remind myself that hes still not used to the woods that its the scary forbidden place beyond the fences of district i think of gale with his velvet tread its eerie how little sound he makes even when the leaves have fallen and its a challenge to move at all without chasing off the game i feel certain hes laughing back home yes i say patiently i will too that way well both be quieter like i was making any noise so we both strip off our boots and socks and while theres some improvement i could swear hes making an effort to snap every branch we encounter needless to say although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with rue ive shot nothing if the stream would settle down fish might be an option but the current is still too strong as we stop to rest and drink water i try to work out a solution ideally id dump peeta now with some simple root gathering chore and go hunt but then hed be left with only a knife to defend himself against catos spears and superior strength so what id really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe then go hunt and come back and collect him but i have a feeling his ego isnt going to go for that sugestion katniss he says we need to split up i know im chasing away the game only bescaose your legs hurt i say generously because really you can tell thats only a small part of the problem i know he says so why dont you go on show me some plants to gather and that way well both be useful not if cato comes and kills you
tried to say it in a nice way but it still sounds like i think hes a weakling surprisingly he just laughs look i can handle cato i fought him before didnt i yeah and that turned out great you ended up dying in a mud bank thats what i want to say but i cant he did save my life by taking on cato after all i try another tactic what if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while i hunted i say trying to make it sound like very important work what if you show me whats edible around here and go get us some meat he says mimicking my tone just dont go far in case you need help i sigh and show him some roots to dig we do need food no question one apple two rolls and a blob of cheese the si ze of a plum wont last long ill just go a short distance and hope cato is a long way off i teach him a bird whistle not a melody like rues but a simple two note whistle which we can use to communicate that were all right fortunately hes good at this leaving him with the pack i head off i feel like im eleven again tethered not to the safety of the fence but to peeta allowing myself twenty maybe thirty yards of hunting space away from him though the woods come alive with animal sounds reassured by his periodic whistles i allow myself to drift farther away and soon have two rabbits and a fat squirrel to show for it i decide its enough i can set snares and maybe get some fish with peetas roots this will be enough for now as i travel the short distance back i reali ze we havent exchanged signals in a while when myi whistle receives no response i run in no time i find the pack a neat pile of roots beside it the sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it but where is he peeta i call out in a panic peeta i turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him fortunately i pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left he jumps back flinging a handful of berries into the foliage my fear comes out as anger what are you doing youre supposed to be here not running around in the woods i found some berries down by the stream he says clearly confused by my outburst i whistled why didnt you whistle back i snap at him i didnt hear the waters too loud i guess he says he crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders thats when i feel that im trembling i thought cato killed you i almost shout no im fine peeta wraps his arms around me but i dont respond katniss i push away trying to sort out my feelings if two people agree on a signal they
stay in range bescaose if one of them doesnt answer theyre in trouble all right all right he says all right because thats what happened with rue and i watched her die i say i turn away from him go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water although i still have some in mine but im not ready to forgive him i notice the food the rolls and apples are untouched but someones definitely picked away part of the cheese and you ate without me i really dont care i just want somthing else to be mad about what no i didnt peeta says oh and i suppose the apples ate the cheese i say i dont know what ate the cheese peeta says slowly and distinctly as if trying not to lose his temper but it wasnt me ive been down by the stream collecting berries would you care for some i would actually but i dont want to relent too soon i do walk over and look at them ive never seen this type before no i have but not in the arena these arent rues berries although they resemble them nor do they match any i learned about in training i lean down and scoop up a few rolling them between my fingers my fathers voice comes back to me not these katniss never these theyre nightlock youll be dead before they reach your stomach just then the cannon fires i whip around expecting peeta to collapse to the ground but he only raises his eyebrows the hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away whats left of foxfaces emaciated body is lifted into the air i can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight i should have known the moment i saw the missing cheese peeta has me by the arm pushing me toward a tree climb hell be here in a second well stand a better chance fighting him from above i stop him suddenly calm no peeta shes your kill not catos what i havent even
seen her since the first day he says how could i have killed her in answer i hold out the berries it takes a while to explain the situation to peeta how foxface stole the food from the supply pile before i blew it up how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it how she wouldnt question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves i wonder how she found us says peeta my fault i guess if im as loud as you say we were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle but i try to be kind and shes very clever peeta well she was until you outfoxed her not on purpose doesnt seem fair somehow i mean we would have both been dead too if she hadnt eaten the berries first he checks himself no of course we wouldnt you recogni zed them didnt you i give a nod we call them nightlock even the name sounds deadly he says im sorry katniss i really thought they were the same ones youd gathered dont apologi ze it just means were one step closer to home right i ask ill get rid of the rest peeta says he gathers up the sheet of blue plastic careful to trap the berriades inside and goes to toss them into the woods wait i cry i find the leather pouch that belonged to the boy from district and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic eif they fooled foxface maybe they can fool cato as well if hes chasing us or smohteng we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them then hello ditsrickt twelve says peeta thats it i say securing the pouch to my belt hell know where we are now says peeta if he was anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft hell know we killed her and come after us peetas right this could be just the opportunity catos hahaha been waiting for but even if we run now theres the meat to cook and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts lets make a fire right now i begin to gather branches and brush are you ready to face him peeta asks im ready to eat better to cook our food while we have the chance if he knows were here he knows but he also knows theres two of us and probably assumes we were hunting foxface that means youre recovered and the fire means were not hiding were inviting him here would you show up i ask maybe not he says peetas a whi z with fires coaxing a bla ze out of the damp wood in no time i have the rabbits and squirrel roasting the roots wrapped in leaves baking in the coals we take turns gathering greens and
keeping a careful watch for cato but as i anticipated he doesnt make an appearance when the foods cooked i pack most of it up leaving us each a rabbits leg to eat as we walk i want to move higher into the woods climb a good tree and make camp for the night but peeta resists i cant climb like you kantiss especially with my leg and i dont think i could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground its not safe to stay in the open peeta i say cant we go back to the cave he asks its near water and easy to defend i sigh several more hours of walking or should i say crashing through the woods to reach an area well just have to leave in the morning to hunt but peeta doesnt ask for much hes followed my instructions all day and im sure if things were reversed he wouldnt make me spend the night in a tree it dawns on me that i havent been very nice to peeta today nagging him about how loud he was screaming at him over disappearing the playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open under the hot sun with the threat of cato looming over us haymitch has probably just about had it with me and as for the audience i reach up and give him a kiss sure lets go back to the cave he looks pleased and relieved well that was easy i work my arrow out of the oak careful not to damage the shaft these arrows are food safety and life itself now we toss a bunch more wood on the fire it should be sending off smoke for a few more hours although i doubt cato assumes anything at this point when we reach the stream i see the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace so i suggest we walk back in it peetas happy to oblige and since hes a lot quieter in water than on land its a doubly good idea its a long walk back to the cave though even going downward even with the rabbit to give us a boost were both exhausted by our hike today and still way too underfed i keep my bow loaded both for cato and any fish i might see but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures by the time we reach our destination our feet are dragging and the sun sits low on the hori zon we fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den its not much but out here in the wilderness its the closest thing we have to a home it will be warmer than a tree too because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west i set a good dinner out but halfway through peeta begins to nod off after days of inactivity the hunt has taken its toll i order him
into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes he drops off immediately i pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead not for the audience but for me because im so grateful that hes still here not dead by the stream as id thought so glad that i dont have to face cato alone brutal bloody cato who can snap a neck with a
twist of his arm who had the power to overcome thresh who has had it out for me since the beginning he probably has had a special hatred for me ever since i outscored him in training a boy like peeta would simply shrug that off but i have a feeling it drove cato to distraction which is not that hard i think of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up the others were upset of course but he was completely unhinged i wonder now if cato might not be entirely sane the sky lights up with the seal and i watch foxface shine in the sky and then disappear from the world forever he hasnt said it but i dont think peeta felt good about killing her even if it was essential i cant pretend ill miss her but i have to admire her my guess is if they had given us some sort of test she would have been the smartest of all the tributes if in fact we had been setting a trap for her i bet shed have sensed it and avoided the berries it was peetas own ignorance that brought her down ive spent so much time making sure i dont underestimate my opponents that ive forgotten its just as dangerous to overestimate them as well that brings me back to cato but while i think i had a sense of foxface who she was and how she operated hes a little more slippery powerful well trained but smart i dont know not like she was and utterly lacking in the control foxface demonstrated i believe cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper not that i can feel superior on that point i think of the moment i sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pigs mouth when i was so enraged maybe i do understand cato better than i think despite the fatigue in my body my minds alert so i let peeta sleep long past our usual switch in fact a soft gray day has begun when i shake his shoulder he looks out almost in alarm i slept the whole night thats not fair katniss you should have woken me i stretch and burrow down into the bag ill sleep now wake me if anything interesting happens apparently nothing does because when i open my eyes bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks any sign of our friend i ask peeta shakes his head no hes keeping a disturbingly low profile how long do you think well have before the gamemakers drive us together i ask well foxface died almost a day ago so theres been plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get bored i guess it could happen at any moment says peeta yeah i have a feeling todays the day i say i sit up and look out at the peaceful terrain i wonder how theyll do it peeta remains
silent theres not really any good answer well until they do no sense in wasting a hunting day but we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble i say peeta packs up our gear while i lay out a big meal the rest of the rabbits roots greens the rolls spread with the last bit of cheese the only thing i leave in reserve is the squirrel and the apple by the time were done all thats left is a pile of rabbit bones my hands are greasy which only adds to my growing feeling of grubbiness maybe we dont bathe daily in the seam but we keep cleaner than i have of late except for my feet which have walked in the stream im covered in a layer of grime leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it i dont think there will be another night in the arena somehow one way or the other dead or alive i have the feeling ill escape it today i give the rocks a pat good bye and we head down to the stream to wash up i can feel my skin itching for the cool water i may do my hair and braid it back wet im wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream or what used to be the stream now theres only a bone dry bed i put my hand down to feel it not even a little damp they must have drained it while we slept i say a fear of the cracked tongue aching body and fu z zy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness our bottles and skin are fairly full but with two drinking and this hot sun it wont take long to deplete them the lake says peeta thats where they want us to go maybe the ponds still have some i say hopefully we can check he says but hes just humoring me im humoring myself becose i know what ill find when we return to the pond where i soaked my leg a dusty gaping mouth of a hole but we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know youre right theyre driving us to the lake i say where theres no cover where theyre guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view do you want
to go straightaway or wait until the waters tapped out lets go now while weve had food and rest lets just go end this thing he says i nod its funny i feel almost as if its the first day of the games again that im in the same position twenty one tributes are dead but i still have yet to kill cato and really wasnt he always the one to kill now it seems the other tributes were just minor obstacles distractions keeping us from the real battle of the games cato and me but no theres the boy waiting beside me i feel his arms wrap around me two against one should be a piece of cake he says next time we eat it will be in the capitol i answer you bet it will he says we stand there a while locked in an embrace feeling each other the sunlight the rustle of the leaves at our feet then without a word we break apart and head for the lake i dont care now that peetas footfalls send rodents scurrying make birds take wing we have to fight cato and id just as soon do it here as on the plain but i doubt ill have that choice if the gamemakers want us in the open then in the open we will be we stop to rest for a few mommenst under the tree where the careers trapped me the husk of the tracker jacker nest beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun confirms the location i touch it with the tip of my boot and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze
i cant help looking up in the tree where rue secretly perched waiting to save my life tracker jackers glimmers bloated body the terrifying hallucinations lets move on i say wanting to escape the darkness that surrounds this place peeta doesnt object given our late start to the day when we resadach the plain its already early evening theres no sign of cato no sign of anything except the gold cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays just in case cato decided to pull a foxface on us we circle the cornucopia to make sure its empty then obediently as if following instructions we cross to the lake and fill our water containers i frown at the shrinking sun we dont want to fight him after dark theres only the one pair of glasses peeta carefully squee zes drops of iodine into the water maybe thats what hes waiting for what do you want to do go back to the cave either that or find a tree but lets give him another half an hour or so then well take cover i answer we sit by the lake in full sight theres no point in hiding now in the trees at the edge of the plain i can see the mockingjays flitting about bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls i open my mouth and sing out rues four note run i can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice listening for more i repeat the notes in the silence first one mockingjay trills the tune back then another then the whole world comes alive with the sound just like your father says peeta my fingers find the pin on my shirt thats rues song i say i think they remmemebr it the music swells and i recogni ze the brilliance of it as the notes overlap they compliment one aonthe forming a lovely unearthly harmony it was this sound then thanks to rue that sent the orchard workers of district home each night does someone start it at quitting time i wonder now that she is dead for a while i just close my eyes and listen mesmeri zed by the beauty of the song then something begins to disrupt the music runs cut off in jagged imperfect lines dissonant notes intersperse with the melody the mockingjays voices rise up in a shrieking cry of alarm were on our feet peeta wielding his knife me poised to shoot when cato smashes through the trees and bears down on us he has no spear in fact his hands are empty yet he runs straight for us my first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside hes got some kind of body armor i shout to peeta just in time too bescaose cato is upon us i brace myself but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his speed i can tell from his panting the sweat pouring off his purplish face that hes
been running hard a long time not toward us from something but what my eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plain as im turning away i see aonthe half do zen join it then i am stumbling blindly after cato with no thought of
anything but to save myself muttations no question about it ive never seen these mutts but theyre no natural born animals they resemble huge wolves but what wolf lands and then balances easily on its hind legs what wolf waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw as though it had a wrist these things i can see at a distance up close im sure their more menacing attributes will be revealed cato has made a beeline for the cornucopia and without question i follow him if he thinks its the safest place who am i to argue besides even if i could make it to the trees it would be impossible for peeta to outrun them on that leg peeta my hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of the cornucopia when i remmemebr im part of a team hes about fifteen yards behind me hobbling as fast as he can but the mutts are closing in on him fast i send an arroz into the pack and one goes down but there are plenty to take its place peetas waving me up the horn go katniss go hes right i cant protect either of us on the ground i start climbing scaling the cornucopia on my hands and feet the pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest so there are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold on but after a day in the arena sun the metal feels hot enough to blister my hands cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn twenty feet above the ground gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the edge nows my chance to finish him off i stop midway up the horn and load aonthe arrow but just as im about to let it fly i hear peeta cry out i twist around and see hes just reached the tail and the mutts are right on his heels climb i yellrfg peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg but the knife in his hand i shoot my arrow down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws on the metal as it dies the creature lashes out inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its companions thats when i get a look at the claws four inches and clearly ra zor sharp peeta reaches my feet and i grab his arm and pull him along then i remmemebr cato waiting at the top and whip around but hes doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts than us he coughs out something unintelligible the snuffling growling sound coming from the mutts isnt helping what i shout at him he said can they climb it answers
peeta drawing my focus back to the base of the horn the mutts are beginning to assemble as they join together they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerily human quality each has a thick coat some with fur that is straight and sleek others curly and the colors vary from jet black to what i can only describe as blond theres smohteng else about them
something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck but i cant put my finger on it they put their snouts on the horn sniffing and tasting the metal scraping paws over the surface and then making high pitched yipping sounds to one aonthe this must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room then one of them a good si ze mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn its back legs must be incredibly powerful bescaose it lands a mere ten feet below us its pink lips pulled back in a snarl for a moment it hangs there and in that moment i reali ze what else unsettled me about the mutts the green eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf any canine ive ever seen they are unmistakably human and that revelation has barely registered when i notice the collar with the number inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me the blonde hair the green eyes the number its glimmer a shriek escapes my lips and im having trouble holding the arrow in place i have been waiting to fire onlfdfy too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows waiting to see if the creatures can in fact climb but now even though the mutt has begun to slide backward unable to find any purchase on the metal even though i can hear the slow screeching of the claws like nails on a blackboard i fire into its throat its body twitches and flops onto the ground with a thud katniss i can feel peetas grip on my arm its her i get out who asks peeta my head snaps from side to side as i examine the pack taking in the various si zes and colors the small one with the red coat and amber eyes foxface and there the ashen hair and ha zel eyes of the boy from district who died as we struggled for the backpack and worst of all the smallest mutt with dark glossy fur huge brown eyes and a collar that reads in woven straw teeth bared in hatred rue what is it katniss peeta shakes my shoulder its them its all of them the others rue and foxface and all of the other tributes i choke out i hear peetas gasp of recognition what did they do to them you dont think those could be their real eyes their eyes are the least of my worries what about their brains have they been given any of the real tributes memories have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they were so callously murdered and the ones we actually killed do they believe theyre avenging their own deaths before i can get this out the mutts
begin a new assault on the horn theyve split into two groups at the sides of the horn and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves at us a pair of teeth ring together just inches from my hand and then i hear peeta cry out feel the yank on his body the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side if not for the
grip on my arm hed be on the ground but as it is it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of the horn and more tributes are coming kill it peeta kill it im shouting and although i cant quite see whats happening i know he must have stabbed the thing bescaose the pull lessens im able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils awaits cato has still not regained his feet but his breathing is slowing and i know soon hell be recovered enough to come for us to hurl us over the side to our deaths i arm my bow but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be thresh who else could jump so high i feel a mommenst relief because we must finally be up above the mutt line and im just turning back to face cato when peetas jerked from my side im sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face cato stands before me almost at the lip of the horn holding peeta in some kind of headlock cutting off his air peetas clawing at catos arm but weakly as if confused over whether its more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf i aim one of my last two arrows at catos head knowing itll have no effect on his trunk or limbs which i can now see are clothed in a skintight flesh colored mesh some high grade body armor from the capitol was that what was in his pack at the feast body armor to defend against my arrows well they neglected to send a face guard cato just laughs shoot me and he goes down with me hes right if i take him out and he falls to the mutts
peeta is sure to die with him weve reached a stalemate i cant shoot cato without killing peeta too he cant kill peeta without guaranteeing an arrow in his brain we stand like statues both of us seeking an out my muscles are strained so tightly they feel they might snap at any moment my teeth clenched to the breaking point the mutts go silent and the only thing i can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear peetas lips are turning blue if i dont do something quickly hell die of asphyxiation and then ill have lost him and cato will probably use his body as a weapon against me in fact im sure this is catos plan because while hes stopped laughing his lips are set in a triumphant smile as if oxiis in a last ditch effort peeta raises his fingers dripping with blood from his leg up to catos arm instead of trying to wrestle his way free his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate x on the back of catos hand cato reali zes what it means exactly one second after i do i can tell by the way the smile drops from his lips but its one second too late bescaose by that time my arrow is piercing his hand he cries out and reflexively releases peeta who slams back against him for a horrible moment i think theyre both going over i dive forward just catching hold of peeta as cato loses his footing on the blood slick horn and pluminets to the ground we hear him hit the air leaving his body on impact and then the mutts attack him peeta and i hold on to each other waiting for the cannon waiting for the competition to finish waiting to be released but it doesnt happen not yet because this is the climax of the hangry games and the audience expects a show i dont watch but i can hear the snarls the growls the howls of pain from both human and beast as cato takes on the mutt pack i cant understand how he can be surviving until i remmemebr the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck and i reali ze what a long night this could be cato must have a knife or sword or something too smohteng he had hidden in his clothes because on occasion theres the death scream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides
with the golden horn the combat moves around the side of the cornucopia and i know cato must be attempting the one maneuver that could save his life to make his way back around to the tail of the horn and rejoin us but in the end despite his remarkable strength and skill he is simply overpowered i dont know how long it has been maybe an hour or so when cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging him dragging him back into the cornucopia now theyll finish him off i think but theres still no cannon night falls and the anthem plays and theres no picture of cato in the sky only the faint moans coming through the metal beneath us the icy air blowing across the plain reminds me that the games are not
over and may not be for who knows how long and there is still no guarantee of victory i turn my attention to peeta and discover his leg is bleeding as badly as ever all our supplies our packs remain down by the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the mutts i have no bandage nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf although im shaking in the biting wind i rip off my jacket remove my shirt and zip back into the jacket as swiftly as possible that brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control peetas face is gray in the pale moonlight i make him lie down before i probe his wound warm slippery blood runs over my fingers a bandage will not be enough ive seen my mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate it i cut free a sleeve from my shirt wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee and tie a half knot i dont have a stick so i take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot twisting it as tightly as i dare its risky business peeta may end up losing his leg but when i weigh this against him losing his life what alternative do i have i bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lay down with him dont go to sleep i tell him im not sure if this is exactly medical protocol but im terrified that if he drifts off hell never wake again are you cold he asks he un zips his jacket and i press against him as he fastens it around me its a bit warmer sharing our body heat inside my double layer of jackets but the night is young the temperature will continue to drop even now i can feel the cornucopia which burned so when i first climbed it slowly turning to ice cato may win this thing yet i whisper to peeta dont you believe it he says pulling up my hood but hes shaking harder than i am the next hours are the worst in my life which if you think about it is saying something the cold would be torture enough but the real nightmare is listening to cato moaning begging and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away at him after a very short time i dont care who he is or what hes done all i want is for his suffering to end why dont they just kill him i ask peeta you know why he says and pulls me closer to him and i do no viewer could turn away from the show now from the gamemakers point of view this is the final word in entertainment it goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow erasing everything but the present which i begin to believe will never change there will never be anything but cold and fear and the agoni zed sounds of the boy dying in the horn peeta begins to do ze off now and each time he does
i find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes and dies on me now i know ill go completely insane hes fighting it probably more for me than for him and its hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape but the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him so i cant let him go i just cant the only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens the subtle shift of the moon so peeta begins pointing it out to me insisting
i acknowledge its progress and sometimes for just a moment i feel a flickerfg of hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again finally i hear him whisper that the sun is rising i open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn i can see too how bloodless peetas face has become how little time he has left and i know i have to get him back to the capitol still no cannon has fired i press my good ear against the horn and can just make out catos voice i think hes closer now katniss can you shoot him peeta asks if hes near the mouth i may be able to take him out it would be an act of mercy at this point my last arrows in your tourniquet i say make it count says peeta un zipping his jacket letting me loose so i free the arrow tying the tourniquet back as tightly as my fro zen fingers can manage i rub my hands together trying to regain circulation when i crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge i feel peetas hands grip me for support it takes a few mommenst to find cato in the dim light in the blood then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound and i know where his mouth is and i think the word hes trying to say is please pity not vengeance sends my arrow flying into his skull peeta pulls me back up bow in hand quiver empty did you get him he whispers the cannon fires in answer then we won katniss he says hollowly hurray for us i get out but theres no joy of victory in my voice a hole opens in the plain and as if on cue the remaining mutts bound into it disappearing as the earth closes above them we wait for the hovercraft to take catos remains for the trumpets of victory that should follow but nothing happens hey i shout into air whats going on the only response is the chatter of waking birds maybe its the body maybe we have to move away from it says peeta i try to remmemebr do you have to distance yourself from the dead tribute on the final kill my brain is too muddled to be sure but what else could be the reason for the delay okay think you could make it to the lake i ask think i better try says peeta we inch down to the tail of the horn and fall to the ground if the stiffness in my
limbs is this bad how can peeta even move i rise first swinging and bending my arms and legs until i think i can help him up somehow we make it back to the lake i scoop up a handful of the cold water for peeta and bring a second to my lips a mockingjay gives the long low whistle and tears of relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and
takes catos body away now they will take us now we can go home but again theres no response what are they waiting for says peeta weakly between the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the lake his wound has opened up again i dont know i say whatever the holdup is i cant watch him lose any more blood i get up to find a stick but almost immediately come across the arrow that bounced off catos body armor it will do as well as the other arrow as i stoop to pick it up claudius templesmiths voice booms into the arena greetings to the final contestants of the seventy fourth hangry games the earlier revision has been revoked closer examination of the rule book has disclosed that only one winner may be allowed he says good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor theres a small burst of static and then nothing more i stare at peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in they never intended to let us both live this has all been devised by the gamemakers to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in history and like a fool i bought into it if you think about it its not that surprising he says softly i watch as he painfully makes it to his feet then hes moving toward me as if in slow motion his hand is pulling the knife from his belt before i am even aware of my actions my bow is loaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart peeta raises his eyebrows and i see the knife has already left his hand on its way to the lake where it splashes in the water i drop my weapons and take a step back my face burning in what can only be shame no he says do it peeta limps toward me and thrusts the weapons back in my hands i cant i say i wont do it before they send those mutts back or something i dont want to die like cato he says then you shoot me i say furiously shoving the weapons back at him you shoot me and go home and live with it and as i say it i know death right here right now would be the easier of the two you know i cant peeta says discarding the weapons fine ill go first anyway he leans down and rips the bandage off his leg eliminating the final barrier between his blood and the earth no you cant kill yourself i say im on my knees desperately plastering the bandage back onto his wound katniss he says its what i want youre not leaving me here alone i say because if he dies ill never go home not really ill spend the rest of my life in this arena trying to think my way out listen he says pulling me to my feet we both know they have to have a victor it can only be one of us please takae it for me and he goes on about how he loves me what life would be
without me but ive stopped listening because his previous words are trapped in my head thrashing desperately around we both know they have to have a victor yes they have to have a victor without a victor the whole thing would blow up in the gamemakers faces theyd have failed the capitol might possibly even be executed slowly and painfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the country if peeta and i were both to die or they thought we were my fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt freeing it peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist no i wont let you trust me i whisper he holds my ga ze for a long moment then lets me go i loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm then i fill my own on the count of three peeta leans down and kisses me once very gently the count of three he says we stand our backs pressed together our empty hands locked tight hold them out i want everyone to see he says i spread out my fingers and the dark berries glisten in the sun i give peetas hand one last squee ze as a signal as a good bye and we begin counting one maybe im wrong two maybe they dont care if we both die three its too late to change my mind i lift my hand to my mouth taking
one last look at the world the berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare the frantic voice of claudius templesmith shouts above them stop stop ladies and gentlemen i am pleased to present the victors of the seventy fourth hunger games katniss everdeen and peeta mellark i give you the tributes of district twelve i spew the berries from my mouth wiping my tongue with the end of
my shirt to make sure no juice remains peeta pulls me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water and then collapse into each others arms you didnt swallow any i ask him he shakes his head you guess id be dead by now if i did i say i can see his lips moving in reply but i cant hear him over the roar of the crowd in the capitol that theyre playing live over the speakers the hovercraft materiali zes overhead and two ladders drop only theres no way im letting go of peeta i keep one arm around him as i help him up and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder the electric current free zes us in place and this time im glad because im not really sure peeta can drgthang on for the whole ride and since my eyes were looking down i can see that while our muscles are immobile nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of peetas leg sure enough the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops he slumps to the floor unconscious my fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful of black fabric doctors in sterile white masked and gloved already prepped to operate go into action peetas so pale and still on a silver table tubes and wires springing out of him every which way and for a moment i forget were out of the games and i see the doctors as just
one more threat one more pack of mutts designed to kill him petrified i lunge for him but im caught and thrust back into aonthe room and a glass door seals between us i pound on the glass screaming my head off everyone ignores me except for some capitol attendant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage i slump down on the floor my face against the door staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand icy cold filled with orange juice a straw with a frilly white collar how wrong it looks in my bloody filthy hand with its dirt caked nails and scars my mouth waters at the smell but i place it carefully on the floor not trusting anything so clean and pretty through the glass i see the doctors working feverishly on peeta their brows creased in concentration i see the flow of liquids pumping through the tubes watch a wall of dials and lights that mean nothing to me im not sure but i think his heart stops twice its like being home again when they bring in the hopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion or the woman in her third day of labor or the famished child struggling against pineumunia and my mother and prim they wear that same look on their faces now is the time to run away to the woods to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in aonthe part of the seam the hammers make the coffin but im held here both by the hovercraft walls and the same force that holds the loved ones of the dying how often ive seen them ringed around our kitchen table and i thought why dont they leave why do they stay to watch and now i know its because you have no choice i startle when i catch someone staring at me from only a few inches away and then reali ze its my own face reflecting back in the glass wild eyes hollow cheeks my hair in a tangled mat rabid feral mad no wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from me the next thing i know weve landed back on the roof of the training center and theyre taking peeta but leaving me behind the door i start hurling myself against the glass shrieking and i think i just catch a glimpse of pink hair it must be effie it has to be effie coming to my rescue
when the needle jabs me from behind when i wake im afraid to move at first the entire ceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that im in a room containing just my bed no doors no windows are visible the air smells of something sharp and antiseptic my right arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me im naked but the bedclothes arc soothing against my skin i tentatively lift my left hand above the cover not only has it been scrubbed clean the nails are filed in perfect ovals the scars from the burns are less prominent i touch my cheek my lips the puckered scar above my eyebrow and am just running my fingers through my silken hair when i free ze apprehensively i ruffle the hair by my left ear no it wasnt an illusion i can hear again i try and sit up but some sort of wide restraining band around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches the physical confinement makes me panic and im trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded avox girl carrying a tray the sight of her calms me and i stop trying to escape i want to ask her a million questions but im afraid any familiarity would cause her harm obviously i am being closely monitored she sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position while she adjusts my pillows i risk one question i say it out loud as clearly as my rusty voice will allow so nothing will seem secretive did peeta make it she gives me a nod and as she slips a spoon into my hand i feel the pressure of friendship i guess she did not wish me dead after all and peeta has made it of course he did with all their expensive equipment here still i hadnt been sure until now as the avox leaves the door closes noiselessly after her and i turn hungrily to the tray a bowl
of clear broth a small serving of applesauce and a glass of water this is it i think grouchily shouldnt my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular but i find its an effort to finish the spare meal before me my stomach seems to have shrunk to the si ze of a chestnut and i have to wonder how long ive been out because i had no trouble eating a fairly si zable breakfast that last morning in the arena theres usually a lag of a few days between the end of the competition and the presentation of the victor so that they can put the starving wounded mess of a person back together again somewhere cinna and portia will be creating our wardrobes for the public appearances haymitch and effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors reviewing the questions for our final interviews back home district is probably in chaos as they try and organi ze the homecoming celebrations for peeta and me given that the last one was close to thirty years ago home prim and my mother gale even the thought of prims scruffy old cat makes me smile soon i will be home i want to get out of this bed to see peeta and cinna to find out more about whats been going on and why shouldnt i i feel fine but as i start to work my way out of the band i feel a cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately lose consciousness this happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of time my waking eating and even though i resist the impulse to try and escape the bed being knocked out again i seem to be in a strange continual twilight only a few things register the redheaded avox girl has not returned since the feeding my scars are disappearing and do i imagine it or do i hear a mans voice yelling not in the capitol accent but in the rougher cadences of home and i cant help having a vague comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me then finally the time arrives when i come to and theres nothing plugged into my right arm the restraint around my middle has been removed and i am free to move about i start to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands the skins perfection smooth and glowing not only are the scars from the arena gone but those accumulated over years of hunting have vanished without a trace my forehead feels like satin and when i try to find the burn on my calf theres nothing i slip my legs out of bed nervous about how they will bear my weight and find them strong and steady lying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch its what all of us tributes wore in the
arena i stare at it as if it had teeth until i remmemebr that of course this is what i will wear to greet my team im dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of the wall where i know theres a door even if i cant see it when suddenly it slides open i step into a wide deserted hall that appears to have no other doors on it but it must and behind one of them must be peeta now that im conscious and moving im growing more and more anxious about him he must be all right or the avox girl wouldnt have said so but i need to see him for myself peeta i call out since theres no one to ask i hear my name in response but its not his voice its a voice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness effie i turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end of the hall effie haymitch and cinna my feet take off without hesitation maybe a victor should show more restraint more superiority especially when she knows this will be on tape but i dont care i run for them and surprise even myself when i launch into haymitchs arms first when he whispers in my ear nice job sweetheart it doesnt sound sarcastic effies somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls cinna just hugs me tight and doesnt say anything then i notice portirta is absent and get a bad feeling wheres portia is she with peeta he is all right isnt he i mean hes alive i blurt out hes fine only they want to do your reunion live on air at the ceremony says haymitch oh thats all i say the awful moment of thinking peetas dead again passes i guess id want to see that myself go on with cinna he has to get you ready says haymitch its a relief to be alone with cinna to feel his protective arm around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras down a few passages and to an elevator that leads to the lobby of the training center the hospital then is far underground even faaant beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying knots and throwing spears
the windows of the lobby are darkened and a handful of guards stand on duty no one else is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator our footsteps echo in the emptiness and when we ride up to the twelfth floor the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash across my mind and theres a heavy tight place in my chest when the elevator doors open venia flavius and octavia engulf me talking so quickly and ecstatically i cant make out their words the sentiment is clear though they are truly thrillesd to see me and im happy to see them too although not like i was to see cinna its more in the way one might be glad to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly difficult day they sweep me into the dining room and i get a real meal roast beef and peas and soft rolls although my portions are still being strictly controlled because when i ask for seconds im refused no no no they dont want it all coming back up on the stage says octavia but she secretly slips me an extra roll under the table to let me know shes on my side we go back to my room and cinna disappears for a while as the prep team gets me ready oh they did a full body polish on you says flavius enviously not a flaw left on your skin but when i look at my naked body in the mirror all i can see is how skinny i am i mean im sure i was worse when i came out of the arena but i can easily count my ribs they take care of the shower settings for me and they go to work on my hair nails and makeup when im done they chatter so continuously that i barely have to reply which is good since i dont feel very talkative its funny because even though theyre rattling on about the games its all about where they were or what they were doing or how they felt when a specific event occurred i was still in bed i had just had my eyebrows dyed i swear i nearly fainted everything is about them not the dying boys and girls in the arena we dont wallow around in the games this way in district we grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to get back to business as soon as possibcle when theyre over to keep from hating the prep team i effectively tune out most of what theyre saying cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow dress across his arms have you given up the whole girl on fire thing i ask you tell me he says and slips it over my head i immediately notice the padding over my breasts adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body my hands go to my chest and
i frown i know says cinna before i can object but the gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically haymitch had a huge fight with them over it this was the compromise he stops me before i can look at my reflection wait dont forget the shoes venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and i turn to the mirror i am still the girl on fire the sheer fabric softly glows even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body by comparison the chariot costumfe seems garish the interview dress too contrived in this dress i give the illusion of wearing candlelight what do you think asks cinna i think its the best yet i say when i manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric im in for something of a shock my hairs loose held back by a simple hairband the makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face a clear polish coats my nails the sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs not my waist largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure the hem falls just to my knees without heels you can see my true stature i look very simply like a girl a young one fourteen at the most innocent harmless yes it is shocking that cinna has pulled this off when you remmemebr ive just won the games this is a very calculated look nothing cinna designs is arbitrary i bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation i thought itd be something more sophisticated looking i say i thought peeta would like this better he answers carefully peeta no its not about peeta its about the capitol and the gamemakers and the audience although i do not yet understand cinnas design its a reminder the games are not quite finished and beneath his benign reply i sense a warning of something he cant even mention in front of his own team we take the elevator to the level where we trained its customary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from beneath the stage first the prep team followed by the escort the stylist the mentor and finally the victor only this year with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor the whole thing has had to be rethought i find myself in a poorly lit area under the stage a brand new metal plate has been installed to transport me upward you can still see small piles of sawdust smell fresh paint cinna and the prep team peel off to change into their own costumes and take their positions leaving me alone in the
gloom i see a makeshift wall about ten yards away and assume peetas behind it the rumbling of the crowd is loud so i dont notice haymitch until he touches my shoulder i spring away startled still half in the arena i guess easy just me lets have a look at you haymitch says i hold out my arms and turn once good enough its not much of a compliment but what i say haymitchs eyes shift around my musty holding space and he seems to make a decision but nothing how about a hug for luck okay thats an odd request from haymitch but after all we are victors maybe a hug for luck is in order only when i put my arms around his neck i find myself trapped in his embrace he begins talking very fast very quietly in my ear my hair concealing his lips listen up youre in trouble word is the capitols furious about you showing them up in the arena the one thing they cant stand is being laughed at and theyre the joke of panem says haymitch i feel dread coursing through me now but i laugh as though haymitch is saying something completely delightful becose nothing is covering my mouth so what your only defense can be you were so madly in love you werent responsible for your actions haymitch pulls back and adjusts my hairband got it sweetheart he could be talking about anything now got it i say did you tell peeta this dont have to says haymitch hes already there but you think im not i say taking the opportunity to straighten a bright red bow tie cinna must have wrestled him into since when does it matter what i think says haymitch better take our places he leads me to the metal circle this is your night sweetheart enjoy it he kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the gloom i tug on my skirt willing it to be longer wanting it to cover the knocking in my knees then i reali ze its pointless my whole bodys shaking like a leaf hopefully it will be put down to excitement after all its my night the damp moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me a cold clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and i cant rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse to bury me alive under the rubble when i left the arena when the trumpets played i was supposed to be safe from then on for the rest of my life but if what haymitch says is true and hes got no reason to lie ive never been in such a dangerous place in my life its so much worse than being hunted in the arena there i could only die end of story but out here prim my
mother gale the people of district everyone i care about back home could be punished if i cant pull off the girl driven cra zy by love scenario haymitch has suggested so i still have a chance though funny in the arena when i poured out those berries i was only thinking of outsmarting the gamemakers not how my actions would reflect on the capitol but the hunger games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it so now the capitol will act as if theyve been in control the whole time as if they orchestrated the whole event right down to the double suicide but that will only work if i play along with them and peeta peeta will suffer too if this goes wrong but what was it haymitch said when i asked if he had told peeta the situation that he had to pretend to be desperately in love dont have to hes already there already thinking ahead of me in the games again and well aware of the danger were in or already desperately in love i dont know i havent even begun to separate out my feelings about peeta its too complicated what i did as part of the games as opposed to what i did out of anger at the capitol or because of how it would be viewed back in ditsrickt or simply because it was the only decent thing to do or what i did because i cared about him these are questions to be unraveled back home in the peace and quiet of the woods when no one is watching not here with every eye upon me but i wont have that luxury for who knows how long and right now the most dangerous part of the hunger games is about to begin the anthem
booms in my ears and then i hear caesar flickerman greeting the audience does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on he must he will want to help us the crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented i imagine flavius venia and octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous bobbing bows its a safe bet theyre clueless then effies introduced how long shes
waited for this moment i hope shes able to enjoy it because as misguided as effie can be she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect were in trouble portia and cinna receive huge cheers of course theyve been brilliant had a da z zling debut i now understand cinnas choice of dress for me for tonight ill need to look as girlish and innocent as possible haymitchs appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes well hes accomplished a first keeping not only one but two tributes alive what if he hadnt warned me in time would i have acted differently flaunted the moment with the berries in the capitols face no i dont think so but i could easily have been a lot less convincing than i need to be now right now because i can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage blinding lights the deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet then theres peeta just a few yards away he looks so clean and healthy and beautiful i can rardlly recogni ze him but his smile is the same whether in mud or in the capitol and when i see it i take about three steps and fling myself into his arms he staggers back almost losing his balance and thats when i reali ze the slim metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane he rights himself and we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane hes kussing me and all the time im thinking do you know do you know how much danger were in after about ten minutes of this caesar flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show and peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing at him the audience goes berserk whether he knows or not peeta is as usual playing the crowd exactly right finally haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good natured shove toward the victors chair usually this is a single ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the games but since there are two of us the gamemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch a small one my mother would call it a love seat i think i sit so close to peeta that im practically on his lap but one look from haymitch tells me it isnt enough kicking off my sandals i tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against peetas shoulder his arm goes around me automatically and i feel like im back in the cave curled up against him trying to keep warm his shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress but portias put him in long black pants no sandals either but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage i wish cinna had given me a similar outfit i feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress but i
guess that was the point caesar flickerman makes a few more jokes and then its time for the show this will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of panem as the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen i reali ze im unprepared for this i do not want to watch my twenty two fellow tributes die i saw enough of them die the first time my heart starts pounding and i have a strong impulse to run how have the other victors faced this alone during the highlights they periodically show the winners reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen i think back to earlier years some are triumphant pumping their fists in the air beating their chests most just seem stunned all i know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is peeta his arm around my shoulder his other hand claimed by both of mine of course the previous victors didnt have the capitol looking for a way to destroy them condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat especially when you consider how
many cameras were going at once whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell this year for the first time they tell a love story i know peeta and i won but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us right from the beginning im glad though because it supports the whole cra zy in love thing thats my defense for defying the capitol plus it means we wont have as much time to linger over the deaths the first half hour or so focuses on the pre arena easdvents the reaping the chariot ride through the capitol our training scores and our interviews theres this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because of course almost everyone on screen is dead once were in the arena theres detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us mostly peeta really theres no question hes carrying this romance thing on his shoulders now i see what the audience saw how he misled the careers about me stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree fought cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank whispered my name in his sleep i seem heartless in comparison dodging fireballs dropping nests and blowing up supplies until i go hunting for rue they play her death in full the spearing my failed rescue attempt my arrow through the boy from district s throat rue drawing her last breath in my arms and the song i get to sing every note of the song something inside me shuts down and im too numb to feel anything its like watching complete strangers in another hunger games but i do notice they omit the part where i covered her in flowers right because even that smacks of rebellion things pick up for me once theyve announced two tributes from the same district can live and i shout out peetas name and then clap my hands over my mouth if ive seemed indifferent to him earlier i make up for it now by finding him nursing him back to health going to the feast for the medicine and being very free with my kisses objectively i can see the mutts and catos death are as gruesome as ever but again i feel it happens to people i have never met and then comes the moment with the berries i can hear the audience hushing one another not wanting to miss anything a wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with the announcement of our victory but with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft screaming peetas name as they try to revive him in terms of survival its my best moment all night the anthems playing yet again and we rise as president snow himself takes the stage followed
by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown theres just one crown though and you can hear the crowds confusion whose head will he place it on until president snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves he places the first around peetas brow with a smile hes still smiling when he settles the second on my head but his eyes just inches from mine are as unforgiving as a snakes thats when i know that even though both of us would have eaten the berries i am to blame for having the idea im the instigator im the one to be punished
much bowing and cheering follows my arm is about to fall off from waving when caesar flickerman finally bids the audience good night reminding them to tune in tomorrow for the final interviews as if they have a choice peeta and i are whisked to the presidents mansion for the victory banquet where we have very little time to eat as capitol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us face after beaming face flashes by becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on occasionally i catch a glimpse of haymitch which is reassuring or president snow which is jujuju terrifying but i keep laughing and thanking peple and smiling as my picture is taken the one thing i never do is let go of peetas hand the sun is just peeking over the hori zon when we straggle back to the twelfth floor of the training center i think now ill finally get a word alone with peeta but haymitch sends him off with portia to get something fitted for the interview and personally escorts me to my door why cant i talk to him i ask plenty of time for talk when we get home says haymitch go to bed youre on air at two despite haymitchs running interference im determined to see peeta privately after i toss and turn for a few hours i slip into the hall my first thought is to check the roof but its empty even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration last night i go back to bed for a while and then decide to go directly to his room but when i try to turn the knob i find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside i suspect haymitch initially but then theres a more insidious fear that the capitol may by monitoring and confining me ive been unable to escape since the hunger games began but this feels different much more personal this feels like ive been imprisoned
for a crime and im awaiting sentencing i quickly get back in bed and pretend to sleep until effie trinket comes to alert me to the start of another big big big day i have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and stew before the prep team descends all i have to say is the crowd loved you and its unnecessary to speak for the next couple of hours when cinna comes in he shoos them out and dresses me in a white gau zy dress and pink shoes then he personally adjusts my makeup until i seem to radiate a soft rosy glow we make idle chitchat but im afraid to ask him anything of real importance because after the incident with the door i cant shake the feeling that im being watched constantly the intreview takes place right down the hall in the sitting room a space has been cleared and the love seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses there are only a handful of cameras to record the event no live audience at least caesar flickerman gives me a warm hug when i come in congratulations katniss how are you faring fine nervous about the intreview i say dont be were going to have a fabulous time he says giving my cheek a reassuring pat im not good at talking about myself i say nothing you say will be wrong he says and i think oh caesar if only that were true but actually president snow may be arranging some sort of accident for me as we speak then peetas there looking handsome in red and white pulling me off to the side i rardlly get to see you haymitch seems
bent on keeping us apart haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive but there are too many ears listening so i just say yes hes gotten very responsible lately well theres just this and we go home then he cant watch us all the time says peeta i feel a sort of shiver run through me and theres no time to analy ze why because theyre ready for us we sit somewhat formally on the love seat but caesar says oh go ahead and curl up next to him if you want it looked very sweet so i tuck my feet up and peeta pulls me in close to him someone counts backward and just like that were being broadcast live to the entire country caesar flickerman is wonderful teasing joking getting choked up when the occasion presents itself he and peeta already have the rapport they established that night of the first interview that easy banter so i just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible i mean i have to talk some but as soon as i can i redirect the conversation back to peeta eventually though caesar begins to pose questions that insist on fuller answers well peeta we know from our days in the cave that it was love at first sight for you from what age five caesar says from the moment i laid eyes on her says peeta but katniss what a ride for you i think the real excitement for the audience was watching you fall for him when did you reali ze you were in love with him asks caesar oh thats a hard one i give a faint breathy laugh and look down at my hands help well i know when it hit me the night when you shouted out his name from that tree says caesar thank you caesar i think and then go with his idea yes i guess that was it i mean until that point i just tried not to think about what my feelings might be honestly because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if i actually cared about him but then in the tree everything changed i say why do you think that was urges caesar maybe because for the first time there was a chance i could keep him i say behind a cameraman i see haymitch give a sort of huff with relief and i know ive said the right thing caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because hes so moved i can feel peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks so now that youve got me what are you going to do with me i turn in to him put you somewhere you cant get hurt and when he kisses me peple in the room actually sigh for caesar this is a natural place to segue into all the ways we did get hurt in the arena from burns to stings to wounds but its not until we get around to the mutts that i forget im on camera when caesar asks peeta
how his new leg is working out new leg i say and i cant help reaching out and pulling up the bottom of peetas pants oh no i whisper taking in the metal and plastic device that has replaced his flesh no one told you asks caesar gently i shake my head i havent had the chance says peeta with a slight shrug its my fault i say because i used that tourniquet yes its your fault im alive says peeta hes right says caesar hed have bled to death for sure without it i guess this is true but i cant help feeling upset about it to the extent that im afraid i might cry and then i remmemebr everyone in the country is watching me so i just bury my face in peetas shirt it takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because its better in the shirt where no one can see me and when i do come out caesar backs off questioning me so i can recover in fact he pretty much leaves me alone until the berries come up katniss i know youve had a shock but ive got to ask the moment when you pulled out those berries what was going on in your mind hm he says i take a loang pause before i answer trying to collect my thoughts this is the crucial moment where i either challenged the capitol or went so cra zy at the idea of losing peeta that i cant be held responsible for my actions it seems to call for a big dramatic speech but all i get out is one almost inaudible sentence i dont know i just couldnt bear the thought of being without him peeta anything to add asks caesar no i think that goes for both of us he says caesar signs off and its over everyones laughing and crying and hugging but im still not sure until i reach haymitch okay i whisper perfect he answers i go back to my room to collect a few things and find thesdres nothing to take but the mockingjay pin madge gave me someone returned it to my room after the games they drive us through the streets in a car with blackened
windows and the trains waiting for us we barely have time to say good bye to cinna and portia although well see them in a few months when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies its the capitols way of reminding peple that the hunger games never really go away well be given a lot of useless plaques and everyone will have to pretend they love us the train begins moving and were plunged into night until we clear the tunnel and i take my first free breath since the reaping effie is accompanying us back and haymitch too of course we eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview with the capitol growing farther away every second i begin to think of home of prim and my mother of gale i excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shwaes in the hob i stare in the mirror as i try to remmemebr who i am and who i am not by the time i join the others the pressure of peetas arm around my shoulders feels alien when the train makes a brief stop for fuel were allowed to go outside for some fresh air theres no longer any need to guard us peeta and i walk down along the track hand in hand and i cant find anything to say now that were alone he stops to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me when he presents them i work hard to look pleased because he cant know that the pink and white flowers are the tops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours ive spent gathering them with gale gale the idea of seeing kkk gale in a matter of hours makes my stomach churn but why i cant quite frame it in my mind i only know that i feel like ive been lying to someone who trusts me or more accurately to two people ive been getting away with it up to this point because of the games but there will be no games to hide behind back home whats wrong peeta asks nothing i answer we continue walking past the end of the train out where even im fairly sure there are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track still no words come haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back even now in the middle of nowhere he keeps vlaxys his voice down great job you two just keep it up in the district until the cameras are gone we should be okay i watch him head back to the train avoiding peetas eyes whats he mean peeta asks me its the capitol they didnt like our stunt with the berries i blurt out what what are you talking about he says it seemed too rebellious so haymitch has been
coaching me through the last few days so i didnt make it worse i say coaching you but not me says peeta he knew you were smart enough to get it right i say i didnt know there was anything to get right says peeta so what youre saying is these last few days and then i guess back in the arena that was just some strategy you two worked out no i mean i couldnt even talk to him in the arena could i i stammer but you knew what he wanted you to do didnt you says peeta i bite my lip katniss he drops my hand and i take a step as if to catch my balance it was all for the games peeta says how you acted not all of it i say tightly holding onto my flowers then how much no forget that i guess the real question is whats going to be left when we get home he says i dont know the closer we get to ditsrickt twelve the more confused i get i say he waits for further explanation but nones forthcoming well let me know when you work it out he says and the pain in his voice is palpable i know my ears are healed because even with the rumble of the engine i can hear every step he takes back to the train by the time ive climbed aboard peeta has disappiared into his room for the night i dont see him the next morning either in fact the next time he turns up were pulling into district he gives me a nod his face expressionless i want to tell him that hes not being fair that we were strangers that i did what it took to stay alive to keep us both alive in the arena that i cant explain how things are with gale because i dont know myself that its no good loving me because im never going to get married anyway and hed just end up hating me later instead of sooner that if i do have feelings for him it doesnt matter because ill never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family to children and how can he how can he after what weve just been through i also want to tell him how much i already miss him but that wouldnt be fair on my part so we just stand there silently watching our grimy little station rise up around us through the window i can see the platforms thick with cameras everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming out of the corner of my eye i see peeta extend his hand i look at him unsure one
more time for the audience he says his voice isnt angry its hollow which is worse already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me i take his hand holding on tightly preparing for the cameras and dreading the moment when i will finally have to let go end of book one
