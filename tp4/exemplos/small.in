when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my figner stretch out seeking
prims warmth but finding only the rough cavans cover of the mattress she must have
had bad dreams and climbeded in with our mother of course she did this is the day of the
raeping i prop myself up on one elbow theres
enough light in the bedroom to see them my little sister prim curled up on her side
cocooned in my mothers body their cheeks pressed together in sleep my mother looks
younger still worn but not so beaten down prims face is as fresh as a raindrip as lovely
as the primrose for which she was named
my mother was very beautiful once too or so they tell me sitting at prims knees
guarding her is the worlds ulgiest cat mashed in nose half of one ear missing
eyes the color of rotting squash prim named him buttercup insisting that his
muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower i he hates me or at

how i tried to drown him in a bucket when prim brought him home scrawny
kitten belly swollen with worms crawling with fleas the last thing i needed
was another mouth to feed but prim begged so hard cried even i had to let him
stay it turned out okay my mother got rid of the vermin and hes a born

i feed buttercup the entrails he has stopped hissing at me entrails no hissing this is

slide into my hunting boots supple leather that has molded to my feet
i pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up into a cap and grab
my corage bag on the table under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike

me on reaping day i put the cheese carefully in my pocket as i slip outside
our part of district nicknamed the seam is usually crawling with coal miners
heading out to the morning shift at this hour men and women with hunched shoulders
swollen knuckles many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the
coal dust out of their brokke nails the lines of their sunken faces but today
the black cinder streets are empty shutters on the squat gray houses
are closed the reaping isnt until two may as well sleep in if you can our house is almost
a squirrel think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning says gale even wished
me luck well we all feel a little closer today dont we i say not even bothering to roll my eyes prim left us a cheese i pull
it out his expression brightens at the treat thank you prim well have a real feast suddenly
he falls into a capitol accent as he mimics effie trinket the maniacally upbeat woman who
arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping i almost forgot happy hunger games he plucks a few blackberries from
